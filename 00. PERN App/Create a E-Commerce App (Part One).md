# Create a E-Commerce App (Part One)

## Overview
For this project, you will build an e-commerce application REST API using your knowledge of server-side web development. E-commerce applications are ubiquitous online and make up the back-bone of online business, making the skills used to build them invaluable for any budding entrepreneur or developer. This project requires that you build a fully-functioning e-commerce application REST API that allows users to perform various CRUD operations such as registering an account, browsing products for sale, etc.
Project Objectives:
* Build a functioning e-commerce REST API using Express, Node.js, and Postgres
* Allow users to register and log in via the API
* Allow CRUD operations on products
* Allow CRUD operations on user accounts
* Allow CRUD operations on user carts
* Allow a user to place an order
* Allow CRUD operations on orders
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer
* Document the API using Swagger

Prerequisites:
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line
* Express
* PostgreSQL

## Project Tasks
[] - Set up local login - Add the logic for handling login using a username and password.
[] - Next Steps - You’re welcome to expand your API beyond these project tasks and get creative! A future portfolio project will build on top of what you have built here, covering tasks for creating the client side of your e-commerce application. If you don’t want to wait that long, you can try building out a client for your API on your own!
[] - Set up user registration - Add the logic for handling registration of new users.
[] - Set up product endpoints - Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to products.
[] - Set up user endpoints - Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to users and their accounts
[] - Set up cart endpoint - Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to a user’s cart.
[] - Set up checkout endpoint - Add the logic for handling checkout. There is no need to actually try and charge somebody yet; charging will come in a later evolution of this project. For now, we will assume that all charges succeed for ease of development (still add in error handling to account for times it doesn’t).
[] - Set up order endpoints - Add the logic for handling CRUD operations related to orders.
[] - Document the API - Document the API you have built by adding and configuring Swagger to your project.
[] - Set up an Express server - Create a directory for your project and set up a basic Express server.
[] - Set up version control - Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.
[] -Design the database - Plan out the different types of data the application will track and how those pieces of data relate.
[] -Create PostgreSQL database and tables - Create a PostgreSQL database and add the tables from your design.
[] -Connect the app and database - Set up your application to be able to interface with the PostgreSQL database.
[] -Plan API endpoints - Plan the API endpoints that will be used in retrieving data from your database.

## Setup
### Going off platform

You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest VSCode) and Git version control. If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, review the Git lesson or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have Node set up locally to be able to run your application.

In addition, make sure you have [PostgreSQL installed locally](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-postgresql-database/modules/fscp-setting-up-postgresql/articles/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally) as your database as well as the [Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) for deployment.

### Debugging Tips

Feeling stuck? Try the following:
* Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
* Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Often times they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
* Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
