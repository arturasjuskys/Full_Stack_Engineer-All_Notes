# Final PERN App

## Overview
In this project, you’ll be coming up with your own topic for a final project. This is your chance to bring together everything that you have learned so far to showcase your skills. Given that you’ll be coming up with the idea as well as building the web app, make sure to give yourself plenty of time - we recommend at least two weeks to a month, depending on how much time you can work on it each day.

### Project Objectives:
* Create a front-end using React.js
* Create a server using Node.js, Express.js
* Use a PostgreSQL database to store your data
* Set up proper security
* Create tests to ensure integrity of your code
* Deploy the web app on Heroku

### Prerequisites:
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Node/Express
* PostgreSQL
* Git and GitHub
* Command line

## Project Tasks
* [ ] Plan the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)- Create a list of features for your project’s MVP
* [ ] Create a Mockup (Front-End) - Create a mockup of your front-end
* [ ] Break the UI into Components - Identify what React components can be derived from the UI mockup
* [ ] Arrange components into a hierarchy - Create a component hierarchy in your folder structure
* [ ] Define where state should live - Define which components should manage application state
* [ ] Implement your Front-End - Use the plans drafted in previous steps and implement them as code
* [ ] Plan the Back-end - Plan your back-end resources by mocking what resources you will use and how you will persist/communicate them. Determine what API endpoints you will have to facilitate this as well as what database tables are required.
* [ ] Create the database - Create the database tables that will be used to persist data
* [ ] Create the Express server - Create an Express server and the API handlers responsible for processing data requests.
* [ ] Secure your endpoints - Add security to your endpoints to protect your data.
* [ ] Create tests - Create tests for the front and backends to ensure the integrity of your code.
* [ ] Deploy to Heroku - Deploy your codebase to Heroku for the world to see.
* [ ] Next steps - Now that you have a working MVP, it’s time to push the project forward in new and exciting directions.

## Setup
### Going off platform
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest VSCode) and Git version control. If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, [review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have Node set up locally to be able to run your script.

### Debugging Tips
Feeling stuck? Try the following:
* Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
* Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Often times they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
* Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
