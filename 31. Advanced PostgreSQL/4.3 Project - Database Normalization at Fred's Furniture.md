# Normalizing a Database
## Database Normalization at Fred's Furniture

A new online furniture store named Fred’s Furniture has hired you as their very first data engineer. Congratulations!

Fred (the owner) knew when he started his business that he should be collecting data about orders, customers, and items. Unfortunately, Fred doesn’t have a background in database engineering, so he has been storing all of this information in a single database table. Now that his business is getting a little bigger, Fred is finding it harder and harder to maintain his database, so he’s hired you to help him redesign it.

Over the course of this project, you will normalize Fred’s database by creating a new set of tables that contain all of the same information. You’ll then have a chance to explore how data modifications and queries differ before and after normalization.

The provided database includes order, customer, and item data for Fred’s first month of business, which is contained in a table named store. Press ‘Start’ to begin inspecting the data.

### Inspect the Data
1. Fred’s database, which contains a single table named store, has been loaded for you. Write a query to select the first 10 rows and all columns (using SELECT *) from the store table and inspect the results. In order to normalize the database, which columns do you think should be moved to separate tables?
2. Have any customers made more than one order? Copy and paste the following query into script.sql to calculate the number of distinct order_id values:
    ```SQL
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) 
    FROM store;
    ```

    Then, write another query using similar syntax to calculate the number of distinct customer_id values. You should see fewer customers than orders, suggesting that some customers have made more than one order!
3. Let’s inspect some of the repeated data in this table. Write a query to return the customer_id, customer_email, and customer_phone where customer_id = 1. How many orders did this customer make?
4. There’s probably even more repeated data in the item-related columns! Write a query to return the item_1_id, item_1_name, and item_1_price where item_1_id = 4. How many orders include this item as item_1?
```SQL
-- 1.
SELECT * FROM store LIMIT 10;

-- 2.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(order_id)) FROM store;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) FROM store;

-- 3.
SELECT
  customer_id,
  customer_email,
  customer_phone
FROM store
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- 4.
SELECT
  item_1_id,
  Item_1_name,
  item_1_price
FROM store
WHERE item_1_id = 4;
```

| order_id | order_date | customer_id | customer_phone | customer_email | item_1_id | item_1_name | item_1_price | item_2_id | item_2_name | item_2_price | item_3_id | item_3_name | item_3_price |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

### Create a Normalized Version of the Database
5. Below is a database schema for a normalized version of this database:
    ![](./img/orders_items_normalized.png)
    Use CREATE TABLE customers AS to create the customers table described in the schema by querying the original store table for the relevant columns. Make sure to only include one row per distinct customer_id.
6. Use the following syntax to designate the customer_id column as the primary key of your new customers table:
    ```SQL
    ALTER TABLE table_name
    ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name);
    ```

    Note: You’ll need to use ALTER TABLE here because the customers table was created by querying an existing table; therefore, it was not possible to set a primary key constraint within the CREATE TABLE statement itself. You’ll also need to write this code AFTER the CREATE TABLE statement from the previous step because tables are deleted and re-created according to script.sql every time you press ‘Save’.
7. Use CREATE TABLE items AS to create the items table described in the normalized schema (diagram below) by querying the original store table for the relevant columns. Make sure to only include one row per distinct item_id.
    <!-- ![](./img/orders_items_normalized.png) -->
8. Designate the item_id column of your new items table as the primary key.
9. Use CREATE TABLE orders_items AS to create the orders_items table described in the normalized schema (diagram below) by querying the original store table for the relevant columns. Each row should correspond to a unique instance of a particular item in a particular order.
    <!-- ![](./img/orders_items_normalized.png) -->
    The first few rows of the orders_items table should look something like:

    | order_id | item_id |
    | -------- | ------- |
    | 55 | 1 |
    | 43 | 1 |
    | 64 | 2 |
    | 98 | 2 |

    Note that this table will allow you to retain the many-to-many relationship between orders and items (each order can contain multiple items; each item can appear in multiple orders).`
10. Use CREATE TABLE orders AS to create the orders table described in the normalized schema (diagram below) by querying the original store table for the relevant columns. Note that you will want to include customer_id in the orders table so that you can still link orders and customers back together.
    <!-- ![](./img/orders_items_normalized.png) -->
11. Designate the order_id column of the orders table as the primary key.
12. Copy and paste following code to designate the customer_id column of the orders table as a foreign key referencing the customer_id column of the customers table:
    ```SQL
    ALTER TABLE orders
    ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
    REFERENCES customers(customer_id);
    ```

    Then, use similar syntax to designate the item_id column of the orders_items table as a foreign key referencing the item_id column of the items table.
13. Designate the order_id column of the orders_items table as a foreign key referencing the order_id column of the orders table.
```SQL
-- 5.
CREATE TABLE customers AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  customer_id,
  customer_phone,
  customer_email
FROM store;

-- 6.
ALTER TABLE customers
ADD PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);

-- 7.
CREATE TABLE items AS
SELECT DISTINCT
  item_1_id AS item_id,
  item_1_name AS item_name,
  item_1_price AS item_price
FROM store
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
  item_2_id AS item_id,
  item_2_name AS item_name,
  item_2_price AS item_price
FROM store
WHERE item_2_id IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT
  item_3_id AS item_id,
  item_3_name AS item_name,
  item_3_price AS item_price
FROM store
WHERE item_3_id IS NOT NULL;

-- 8.
ALTER TABLE items
ADD PRIMARY KEY (item_id);

-- 9.
CREATE TABLE orders_items AS
SELECT order_id, item_1_id AS item_id FROM store
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, item_2_id AS item_id FROM store
WHERE item_2_id IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, item_3_id AS item_id FROM store
WHERE item_3_id IS NOT NULL;

-- 10.
CREATE TABLE orders AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  order_date,
  customer_id
FROM store;

-- 11.
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD PRIMARY KEY (order_id);

-- 12.
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers(customer_id);

ALTER TABLE orders_items
ADD FOREIGN KEY (item_id)
REFERENCES items(item_id);

-- 13.
ALTER TABLE orders_items
ADD FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
REFERENCES orders(order_id);
```

### Query your Databases!
14. Congratulations! You now have sets of database tables that contain the same information. The first has a single database table named store. The second has four database tables: orders, orders_items, items, and customers.

    Due to the constraints of the learning environment on Codecademy, all of these tables are currently stored in the same database; however, for the remainder of this project, we are going to imagine them as separate databases (one that’s not normalized and one that is normalized) so that we can compare them.

    Query the original store table to return the emails of all customers who made an order after July 25, 2019 (hint: use WHERE order_date > '2019-07-25').
15. Now, query your normalized database tables to return the emails of all customers who made an order after July 25, 2019 (the normalized database tables are: orders, orders_items, customers, and items). Is this easier or more difficult to do with the normalized database tables?
16. Query the original store table to return the number of orders containing each unique item (for example, two orders contain item 1, two orders contain item 2, four orders contain item 3, etc.)

    Hint: you’ll need to use UNION ALL twice to stack the three item id columns on top of each other, then use the WITH key word to query the results of your union table using COUNT and GROUP BY.
17. Query your normalized database tables to return the number of orders containing each unique item. Is this easier or more difficult to do with the normalized database tables?
18. Experiment with the normalized and non-normalized database tables as much as you’d like! What types of queries are easier with the normalized tables? What types of queries are more difficult?
    #### HINT:
    Other questions you might try to answer:
    * ow many customers made more than one order? What are their emails?
    * mong orders that were made after July 15, 2019, how many included a 'lamp'?
    * How many orders included a 'chair'?
```SQL
-- 14.
SELECT customer_email FROM store
WHERE order_date > '2019-07-25';

-- 15.
SELECT customer_email FROM orders, customers
WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
AND order_date > '2019-07-25';

-- 16.
WITH all_items AS (
  SELECT item_1_id AS item_id FROM store
  UNION ALL
  SELECT item_2_id AS item_id FROM store
  WHERE item_2_id IS NOT NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT item_3_id AS item_id FROM store
  WHERE item_3_id IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) FROM all_items
GROUP BY item_id;

-- 17.
SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) FROM orders_items
GROUP BY item_id;
```
