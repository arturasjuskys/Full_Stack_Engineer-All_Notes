# How Do I Make Sure My Database Stays Fast?
# Introduction to Indexes

## What is an Index?
When working with databases on Codecademy, many lessons use relatively small databases. However, when working with databases in practice, they can become massive very quickly. Imagine, for instance, if you had a database with all the purchases, sales, employees, shipping data, and so on for a large retailer like Target, Wal-Mart, or Amazon. Their databases must be massive! Without good organization, large databases like that can become nothing more than a pile of unusable information. Designing your database thoughtfully with multiple tables, keys, and relationships can help, but what if you want to search through this massive amount of data and find specific records? That is where indexing comes into play.

An index is an organization of the data in a table to help with performance when searching and filtering records. A table can have zero, one, or many indexes. There are some costs when using indexes, which we will cover later in this lesson.

Let’s start by learning how to see what indexes already exist on a table. Say you want to see what indexes exist on your products table you would run the following query:
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'products';
```

pg_Indexes is a built-in view in PostgreSQL. Different database servers have different ways to see their indexes.

During this lesson, we will be working mostly with a table customers created with randomly generated information. Depending on the exercise, the number of records might change to help with run times, but the structure of the table will remain unchanged.

In this lesson you will learn about:
* What an index is and how they function.
* How to build an index.
* How to drop an index.
* Multicolumn indexes to expand the power of your indexes.
* Some of the benefits and burdens of indexes.

### EXERCISES
1. Query the database to get a sense of what the database will look like. This exercise is only a subset of the full data we will be using in other exercises to give you a sense of the type of information we will be working with without slowing down your experience. Select all the rows from the customers table. Take a look at the output, notice the columns and data that is returned. As this will be our main table we will be working with it will be beneficial to become familiar with it.
2. Lookup any indexes that already exist in the customers table. You will need to scroll down towards the bottom of the output. You should see another query with the columns schemaname, tablename, etc. These are the indexes currently associated with the table.

    Pay particualar attention to tablename, indexname and indexdef. What do you think each of these represents?
```SQL
-- 1.
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- 2.
SELECT * FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'customers';
```

| ustomer_id | first_name | last_name | email_address | home_phone | city | state_name | years_old |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---- | ---------- | --------- |
| 1 | Edward | Lewis | Edward.Lewis@example.com | 202-555-0264 | Pittsburgh | Pennsylvania | 82 |
| 2 | Frances | Campbell | Frances.Campbell@example.com | 202-555-0073	North Las | Vegas | Nevada | 10 |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---- | ---------- | --------- |
| 100 | Lawrence | Miller | Lawrence.Miller@example.com | 202-555-0398 | Glendale | Arizona | 44 |

| schemaname | tablename | indexname | tablespace | indexdef |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| cc_user | customers | customers_pkey | | CREATE UNIQUE INDEX customers_pkey ON cc_user.customers USING btree (customer_id) |

## What is the benefit of an Index?
Indexing allows you to organize your database structure in such a way that it makes finding specific records much faster. By default it divides the possible matching records in half, then half, then half, and so on until the specific match you are searching for is found. This is known as a Binary Tree, or B-Tree.

Let’s consider an example to expand on this concept. Say you had a sales department where you ranked your clients from number 1 to 100 in order of loyalty. If you wanted to search the database for your most loyal client, who would have a loyalty score of 100, you would have to search every record (the highest loyalty score could be anywhere in the data set). If you created an index on loyality_score, you could now use the B-Tree structure to speed up that search. The search would divide all results in half, so in this case, the first check would be if the record you are searching for is greater than or less than 50.

If you are familiar with logarithms, the worst-case speed for a B-Tree to find a record is log2n, where without it you would have to check every record, so the read time would be n.

In small databases this is negligible, but as the datasets get larger this becomes more significant. To highlight this, let us say you were searching 1,000,000 records. Without an index on the column you were searching, you would need to look through all 1,000,000 records (assuming its a non-unique column). With a B-Tree index, in the worst case, you would have to search 20 comparisons (log2n).

## Impact of Indexes
Let’s do some experimenting now to see the power of indexes in practice. We will cover the cost of indexes later on, for now, let’s just focus on the positive aspects of them: filtering data.

As a note, this page will most likely run slower for you than any other exercise in this lesson. In order to see the benefits of an index, you need a large database. It may take some time to load the database and run your code. In future exercises, we will be working with smaller databases to not slow down your experience, but it’s important for you to see the impact indexes can have, so please have patience with this exercise.

To get insight into how PostgreSQL breaks down your statements into runnable parts, we can investigate the query plan by adding EXPLAIN ANALYZE before your query. Rather than returning the results of the query, it will return information about the query.
```SQL
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT *
FROM customers;
```

This would return the plan that the server will use to give you every row from every record from the customers table.

There is a good amount of information on what you can get from this and a full understanding is outside the scope of this lesson. If you would like to learn more, PostgreSQL’s official website has a full explanation of [EXPLAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html).

For now, there are a few key things you should take note of. The first is the planner will specifically tell you how it is searching. If you see “Seq Scan” this means that the system is scanning every record to find the specific records you are looking for. If you see “Index” (in our examples more specifically “Bitmap Index Scan”) you know that the server is taking advantage of an index to improve the speed of your search.

The other part to take note of is the “Planning time” and “Execution time”. The planning time is the amount of time the server spends deciding the best way to solve your query, should it use an index, or do a full scan of the table(s) for instance. The execution time is the amount of time the actual query takes to run after the server has decided on a plan of attack. You need to take both of these into consideration, and when examining your own indexes these are critical to understanding how effective your indexes are.

### EXERCISES
1. Let’s start with a search on a column without an index. Select all columns from the rows of the customers table where first_name is 'David'. Before running your query, add EXPLAIN ANALYZE to the start of it.
2. The first_name column doesn’t have an index on it, but the last_name column does. Select all columns from the rows where last_name is 'Jones'. Again, add EXPLAIN ANALYZE to the start of the query. Did the index help?
```SQL
-- 1.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE first_name = 'David';

-- 2. example below
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE last_name = 'Jones';
```

| QUERY PLAN |
| ---------- |
| Bitmap Heap Scan on customers (cost=12.29..1003.86 rows=500 width=466) (actual time=0.267..0.905 rows=1008 loops=1) | 
| Recheck Cond: ((last_name)::text = 'Jones'::text) |
| Heap Blocks: exact=714 |
| -> Bitmap Index Scan on customers_last_name_idx (cost=0.00..12.17 rows=500 width=0) (actual time=0.194..0.195 rows=1008 loops=1) |
| Index Cond: ((last_name)::text = 'Jones'::text) |
| Planning time: 0.068 ms |
| Execution time: 0.962 ms |

## How to Build an Index
Now that we have talked about what an index is for, let us now build one ourselves.

In PostgreSQL, the CREATE INDEX keywords can be used to create an index on a column of a table. Say you wanted to create an index called customers_user_name_idx on the customers table on the user_name column, this is how you would do that:
```SQL
CREATE INDEX customers_user_name_idx ON customers (user_name);
```

Keep in mind that indexes are great for searching but like everything in life, nothing comes without a cost. In the case of indexes, it comes at the cost of increased runtime for any modification to the table data impacting the user_name column. Another cost is the space that the index takes up. We will go into more detail on these issues later.

### EXERCISES
1. Create an index called customers_city_idx on the customers table for the city column.

    If you would like to confirm your index was successfully built you can check the table to see, recall this is done by running:
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM pg_Indexes
    WHERE tablename = 'customers';
    ```
```SQL
-- 1.
CREATE INDEX customers_city_idx ON customers (city);

SELECT * FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'customers';
```

| schemaname | tablename | indexname | tablespace | indexdef |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| cc_user | customers | customers_pkey | | CREATE UNIQUE INDEX customers_pkey ON cc_user.customers USING btree (customer_id) |
| cc_user | customers | customers_city_idx | | CREATE INDEX customers_city_idx ON cc_user.customers USING btree (city) |

## Index Filtering
When you are building indexes, keep in mind that they will be used for filtering your data quickly. Queries that filter data often use WHERE and ON clauses. If an index is created on the columns referenced in these clauses, the database server will examine the index to see if it will improve the speed of the query.

Say you were asked to get the number of orders placed by each person with the last name of 'Smith' or 'Jones', you could get that by running the following query.
```SQL
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS NumOforders
FROM customers       AS c
INNER JOIN orders    AS o    
ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.last_name IN ('Smith', 'Jones')
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name;
```

(Note: if the codeblock is hard to read, drag the boundary of this pane to make it wider.)

In this script, the WHERE clause is filtering the possible customers by the last_name. If there is an index on customers.last_name the database server will use this to quickly find the specific customers to examine.

Another filter in this query is the INNER JOIN between orders and customers on the customer_id. If there are indexes on these columns (one on orders.customer_id and another for customers.customer_id) they could also be searched faster using the respective indexes.

Filtering isn’t perfect and when you add on ANDs and ORs it can complicate the filtering. Often real-world queries can get very complicated joining multiple tables each with an ON clause which may or may not use an index and multiple possible clauses in the WHERE.

The server needs to process all of these and identify the best way to filter the information. Sometimes even if you have an index for the specific situation, the server might not use it. Testing is critical for the specific queries you are working with. However, this in-depth analysis is outside the scope of this lesson, but it is important you are aware of it.

### EXERCISES
1. In the example above, the WHERE clause is filtering the customers table based on the last_name it is interested in finding. Let’s add an index to improve future searches on this Table/Column. Don’t forget the naming convention for indexes,

    If you would like to confirm your index was successfully built you can check the table to see, recall this is done by running:
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM pg_Indexes
    WHERE tablename = 'customers';
    ```
```SQL
-- 1.
CREATE INDEX customers_last_name_idx ON customers (last_name);

SELECT * FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'customers';
```

## Multicolumn Indexes
What if you have two or more columns that are always associated together. Can you combine them to make a more appropriate index? Much like constraints, you can combine multiple columns together as a single index. When using multicolumn indexes, the search structure will be based on the values found in all of the columns.

For example, an index on First and Last Name might be a good idea if it is common to search by both together in your situation. Consider a table where the last names 'Smith' and 'Johnson' appear many times. Having another filter for the first name can help you find someone named 'Sarah Smith' much faster.

The index is built in the specific order listed at creation, so (last_name, first_name) is different from (first_name, last_name). Keep this in mind when you are building your indexes as the order will impact the efficiency of your searches.

Say you want to find 'David', 'Rachel', and 'Margaret' from the first_name column with the last_name of 'Smith'. If there is an index (last_name, first_name), the server would find everyone with the last name 'Smith' then in that much smaller group, find the specific first names you are searching for. If the index is (first_name, last_name) the server would go to each of the first_name records you are interested in and then search for the last name 'Smith' within each one. In general, there isn’t a right or wrong order, it’s about what is appropriate for your setup and what you expect the index to be used for. If there is a good use for it, you could create both indexes as well! If both are present, when you run your script, the database server will determine which index to use based on your query. But remember, indexes take up space, so you shouldn’t always create every index you can think of.

Recall the way to create an index is:
```SQL
CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> (<column_name>);
```

For a multicolumn index you only need to list out each of the columns in the order you wish them to be used. So if we wanted to create an index called customers_last_name_first_name_idx for the customers table for the combination of last_name and first_name it would be written like this
```SQL
CREATE INDEX customers_last_name_first_name_idx ON customers (last_name, first_name);
```
In theory, you could list as many columns as your table has. We will discuss later why, in most cases, this would not be a good use of an index.

As a note, you might hear a multicolumn index referred to by other names as well, such as Composite or Compound.

### EXERCISES
1. Run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT for all columns where last_name is 'Jones' and first_name is 'David' (remember PostgreSQL is case sensitive). Note that we haven’t created an index yet. Let’s see how long this query takes without an index.
2. Create a multicolumn index on customers for last_name and first_name (in that order) called customers_last_name_first_name_idx.
3. Run the EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT again for all columns where last_name is 'Jones' and first_name is 'David' (remember PostgreSQL is case sensitive) now that we have created the multicolumn index, compare the results of the two runs.
```SQL
-- 1.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE last_name = 'Jones' AND first_name = 'David';

-- 2.
CREATE INDEX customers_last_name_first_name_idx ON customers (last_name, first_name);

-- 3.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE last_name = 'Jones' AND first_name = 'David';
```

## Drop an Index
In PostgreSQL, the DROP INDEX command can be used to drop an existing index. We will soon go over why you might want to drop an index you have built, but for now, let’s learn the syntax to drop an index.

Say we want to drop the index customers_city_idx, Note that we pair the DROP statement with the optional IF EXISTS to protect from execution errors.
```SQL
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS customers_city_idx;
```

We will get into some situations where you might want to drop an index you have already created in the following exercises. For now, though, you need to know how to drop them when appropriate.

### EXERCISES
1. Examine the current indexes on the customers table. As a reminder, this is how you examine the indexes on a table.
    ```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM pg_Indexes
    WHERE tablename = '<table_name>';
    ```
2. Drop the index customers_last_name_idx
3. After dropping the index, query pg_Indexes for the customers table again to see the change.
```SQL
-- 1.
SELECT * FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'customers';

-- 2.
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS customers_last_name_idx;

-- 3.
SELECT * FROM pg_Indexes
WHERE tablename = 'customers';
```

## Why not Index every Column?
You might be asking yourself if indexes are so wonderful and help speed searches up, why not create an index on every column? The short answer is that everything has a cost. Indexes speed up searching and filtering, however, they slow down insert, update, and delete statements.

Let’s look at each in turn. The easiest to understand is how an index works with an insert statement. When you insert a record into a non-indexed table the database server simply adds the record(s) onto the end of the table. However, when we add a record to a table that has an index, the index itself must be modified by the server as well. Recall that at its core, an index is an organization of the data in a table. When new data is added, the index will be reshaped to fit that new data into its organization. This means that when you write a single statement to modify the records, the server will have to modify every index that would be impacted by this change. If you are adding a large amount of data to an existing table, it may be better to drop the index, add the data, and then recreate the index rather than having to update the index on each insertion.

Keep in mind that these drawbacks are for each index you have on your table. If you have multiple indexes on a single table and you insert a record, you will need to update each index associated with the table. This can make indexes very costly.

Updates and deletes have similar drawbacks. When deleting a record that is associated with an index, it might be faster to find the record — by leveraging the index’s ability to search. However, once the record is found, removing or editing it will result in the same issue as inserting a new record. The index itself will need to be redone. Note that if you’re updating a non-indexed column, that update will be unaffected by the index. So if you are updating a non-indexed column while filtering by one with an index, an update statement can actually be faster with an index.

The key to indexes is to plan on when an index will help you and stay away from them when they will get in the way.

## Why not Index every Column (cont)?
Another place where an index falls short of perfection is that indexes take up space. The index data structures can sometimes take up as much space as the table itself. If you have not worked with large databases before you might be thinking to yourself, “who cares, storage space is cheap nowadays”. However, databases of decent size can easily get into the gigabyte size range quickly.

This means every time your Database Administrator does a full backup, all of that information, indexes included, are copied. Also consider copying the database to a different environment for testing/development, or running your database on different servers and at different physical locations. All of that data goes across the internet and some companies pay for data usage across networks on their plans. If you then bloat your database size by creating an index on every column, you have compounded all these issues and expenses. Given the speed advantages indexes can provide when used properly, you should not ignore them, but keep in mind this balance.

If you wanted to examine the size of a table products you would run:
```SQL
SELECT pg_size_pretty (pg_total_relation_size('products'));
```

## When should I add an Index?
You may be asking “When should I add an index to my database?” The simple answer is when the benefits of searching outweigh the burdens of storage size and Insert/Update/Delete speed. One thing to consider is whether searching will occur often enough to make the advantages worth the time and effort.

In the real world, this often becomes a grey area and one that you might have to go back to after trying for a while. You will want to look at what a table is used for and by who. As a very rough rule of thumb, think carefully about any index on a table that gets regular Insert/Update/Delete. In contrast, a table that is fairly stable but is searched regularly might be a good candidate for an index.

There are some other conditions that can impact your search times you should be aware of when using an index.

The higher the percentage of a table you are returning the less useful an index becomes. If we’re only searching for 1 record in 1,000,000, an index could be incredibly useful. However, if we are searching for 900,000 out of that same 1,000,000 the advantages of an index become useless. At higher percentages, the query planner might completely ignore your index and do a full table scan, making your index only a burden on the system.

Along this same line, if you are combining filtering conditions be aware of what you will be searching on. AND statements are normally fine and the query planner will try to use an indexed field before non-indexed fields to cut down on the total number of records needed to be searched. OR on the other hand, can be very dangerous; even if you have a single non-indexed condition, if it’s in an OR, the system will still have to check every record in your table, making your index useless.

For instance, if you have the following index on the customers table
```SQL
CREATE INDEX customers_idx ON customers (last_name);
```

Then you ran the following two queries
```SQL
EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name = 'Jones'
  AND first_name = 'David';
 
EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name = 'Jones'
  OR first_name = 'David';
```

The first would run in ~1ms, the second would take ~33ms (in a local version of the customers table with 100k records). Because the first one uses the index it can jump right to just the records with the last_name = 'Jones'. However, in the second with the OR, the index is useless since every record has to be searched anyway for any record with first_name = 'David'. The index is ignored and the system looks at every record once, checking both conditions.

## Review
Indexes are powerful tools that when used properly can drastically improve the speed of your database queries, but when used carelessly can cause more harm than good. Like all powerful tools the user needs to be responsible and know what they are doing. Plan ahead, test your changes in small batches and don’t be afraid to go back and undo/change an index you have created if it isn’t giving you the improvement you were expecting.

We covered:
* What an index is and how they function.
* How to see what indexes exist on a table
  ```SQL
  SELECT *
  FROM pg_indexes
  WHERE tablename = '<table_name>';
  ```
* EXPLAIN ANALYZE can be a powerful tool to see how your queries are impacted by an index.
* How to build an index
  ```SQL
  CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> (column_name);
  ```
* Multicolumn indexes allow for more than one column to be used in combination as an index on a table
  ```SQL
  CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> (<column_name1>, <column_name2>...);
  ```
* You can drop an index. This might be useful to do if you are modifying a large number of records on an indexed table.
  ```SQL
  DROP INDEX IF EXISTS <index_name>;
  ```
* To see the size of a database table you can run the script
  ```SQL
  SELECT pg_size_pretty (pg_total_relation_size('<table_name>'));
  ```
* Some of the benefits and burdens of indexes:
  * Increase in speed of searches/filtering
  * Increase in storage space
  * Increase in runtime for Insert/Update/Delete on impacted indexes.
