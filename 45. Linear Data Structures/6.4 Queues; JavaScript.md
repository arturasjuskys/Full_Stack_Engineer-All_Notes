# Queues
# Learn Queues: JavaScript

## Introduction: Queues in JavaScript
As previously mentioned, a queue is a data structure that contains an ordered set of data that follows a FIFO (first in, first out) protocol for accessing that data.

You can visualize it as a checkout line at a supermarket:
* The customer at the front of the line (equivalent to the head in a queue) is the first customer to pay for their groceries.
* Any new customer must go to the back of the line (the tail of the queue) and wait until everyone in front of them has paid for their groceries (no line cutters allowed in this supermarket!)
* The supermarket cashier only needs to check out the customer at the front of the line

Real-life computer science applications of queues are all around us: search algorithms like BFS (breadth-first search), job schedulers that run tasks on our computers, and keyboard processing that interprets our keystrokes are all queue based.

We’ll also set up a few helper methods that will help us keep track of the queue size in order to prevent queue overflow and underflow.

To do this, we’ll make use of some data structures you’ve already seen: nodes and linked lists. Feel free to take a look at the Node.js and LinkedList.js files in the code editor to review how these data structures are implemented and see what methods are available to you to use in this lesson’s exercises.

`Node.js`
```JS
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }

  setNextNode(node) {
    if (!(node instanceof Node)) {
      throw new Error('Next node must be a member of the Node class');
    }
    this.next = node;
  }

  setNext(data) {
    this.next = data;
  }

  getNextNode() {
    return this.next;
  }
}

module.exports = Node;
```
`LinkedList.js`
```JS
const Node = require('./Node');

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  addToHead(data) {
    const nextNode = new Node(data);
    const currentHead = this.head;
    this.head = nextNode;
    if (currentHead) {
      this.head.setNextNode(currentHead);
    }
  }

  addToTail(data) {
    let lastNode = this.head;
    if (!lastNode) {
      this.head = new Node(data);
    } else {
      let temp = this.head;
      while (temp.getNextNode() !== null) {
        temp = temp.getNextNode();
      }
      temp.setNextNode(new Node(data));
    }
  }

  removeHead() {
    const removedHead = this.head;
    if (!removedHead) {
      return;
    }
    this.head = removedHead.getNextNode();
    return removedHead.data;
  }

  printList() {
    let currentNode = this.head;
    let output = '<head> ';
    while (currentNode !== null) {
      output += currentNode.data + ' ';
      currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    output = output.concat("<tail>");
    console.log(output);
  }
}

module.exports = LinkedList;
```

### Exercises
1. Within Queue.js and inside of the Queue class, we’ve given you a .constructor() method. Since all new queues are empty, they have 0 nodes.

    Inside of the .constructor(), create a property that tracks the number of elements in a queue and call it size.
2. Check your work. Uncomment the code at the bottom of the file, run it, and read the message logged to the terminal.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    // 1.
    this.size = 0;
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;

// 2.
const restaurantOrders = new Queue();
console.log(`restaurantOrders has ${restaurantOrders.size} nodes`);
```
```
restaurantOrders has 0 nodes
```

## Queue Methods: Enqueue
Enqueue is a fancy way of saying “add to a queue,” and that is exactly what we’re doing with the .enqueue() method.

When adding a node to a queue, the new node is always added to the end of the queue. If the queue is empty, the node we’re adding becomes both the head and tail of the queue. If the queue has at least one other node, the added node only becomes the new tail.

Let’s put this into action by building out an .enqueue() method for Queue.

### Exercises
1. Inside the Queue class you built, define an instance method .enqueue() that takes a value, data, as a parameter.
2. Add a new node to the queue. Do this by calling the method that adds a new value to the end of the underlying linked list.
3. The size property tracks the number of nodes in a queue. It should increase as nodes are added and decrease as nodes are removed.

    Add code to increment the queue’s size by 1 every time a node is added to the queue.
4. If the enqueue was successful, add code in the .enqueue() method that logs a message telling us what was added and the new size of the queue. If we ran the following code:
    ```JS
    const groceries = new Queue();
    groceries.enqueue('eggs'); 
    ```

    It should log a message that tells us what was added and the new size of the queue:
    ```
    Added eggs! Queue size is now 1.
    ```

5. Check your work. Uncomment the code at the bottom of the file to run it and read the messages logged to the terminal.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.size = 0;
  }
  // 1.
  enqueue(data) {
    // 2.
    this.queue.addToTail(data);
    // 3.
    this.size++;
    // 4.
    console.log(`Added ${data}! Queue size is now ${this.size}`);
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;

// 5.
const restaurantOrder = new Queue();
console.log(`restaurantOrder queue has ${restaurantOrder.size} orders.\n`);
restaurantOrder.enqueue('apple pie');
restaurantOrder.enqueue('roast chicken');
restaurantOrder.enqueue('quinoa salad');
```
```
restaurantOrder queue has 0 orders.

Added apple pie! Queue size is now 1
Added roast chicken! Queue size is now 2
Added quinoa salad! Queue size is now 3
```

## Queue Methods: Dequeue
We can add items to the tail of our queue, but we remove them from the head using a method known as .dequeue(), which is another way to say “remove from a queue.”

Our .dequeue() removes the current head and replaces it with the following node. The .dequeue() method should also return the value of the head node.

If the queue has one node, when we remove it, the queue will be empty. If the queue has more than one node, we just remove the head node and reset the head to the following node.

### Exercises
1. Inside the Queue class you built, define a method .dequeue() that:
    * Gets the value from the correct node using a LinkedList method
    * Stores the value in a constant called data
    * Finally, returns the value stored in data
2. Since we’re removing a node from the queue, we’ll need to update the queue’s size. Decrement the queue’s size by 1.
3. If the dequeue was successful, log a message that tells us what was removed and the new size of the queue.

    If we ran the following code:
    ```JS
    groceries = new Queue();
    groceries.enqueue('eggs');
    groceries.dequeue();
    ```

    It should return this string that tells us what was added and the new size of the queue:
    ```
    Removed eggs! Queue size is 0.
    ```
4. Uncomment the code at the bottom of the text editor, run it, and read the messages logged in the terminal.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.size = 0;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    this.queue.addToTail(data);
    this.size++;
    console.log(`Added ${data} to queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
  }
  // 1.
  dequeue() {
    const data = this.queue.removeHead();
    // 2.
    this.size--;
    // 3.
    console.log(`Removed ${data}!Queue size is ${this.size}`);
    // 1.
    return data;
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;

// 4.
const restaurantOrder = new Queue();
restaurantOrder.enqueue('apple pie');
restaurantOrder.enqueue('roast chicken');
restaurantOrder.enqueue('quinoa salad');
console.log('\nFood preparing...\n')
restaurantOrder.dequeue();
restaurantOrder.dequeue();
restaurantOrder.dequeue();
console.log('All orders ready!')
```
```
Added apple pie to queue! Queue size is now 1.
Added roast chicken to queue! Queue size is now 2.
Added quinoa salad to queue! Queue size is now 3.

Food preparing...

Removed apple pie!Queue size is 2
Removed roast chicken!Queue size is 1
Removed quinoa salad!Queue size is 0
All orders ready!
```

## Bounded Queues
Some queues require limits on the number of nodes they can have, while other queues don’t. Queues that restrict the number of elements they can store are called bounded queues.

Let’s make our queue a bounded queue. To account for this, we will need to make some modifications to our Queue class so that we can keep track of and limit size where needed.

We’ll be adding a new property to help us out here:
* .maxSize, a property that bounded queues can utilize to limit the total node count

In addition, we will add two new methods:
* .hasRoom() returns true if the queue has space to add another node
* .isEmpty() returns true if the size of a queue is 0

### Exercises
1. Currently, our Queue class only creates unbounded queues or queues without size limits. We will add code to the Queue .constructor() that lets us specify the maximum size of a queue when it’s first created but will otherwise default to Infinity, a type of numeric value in JavaScript.

    Because Infinity doesn’t have the same behavior as and is larger than other numbers, using it is useful as a default value where it acts as a threshold or ceiling we don’t want to pass.

    Add a new parameter maxSize to your .constructor() method that has a default value of Infinity. This ensures that if we don’t specify a maximum size we’ll create an unbounded queue.

    Then store the maxSize parameter in a property also called .maxSize.
2. Below .constructor(), define a helper method .hasRoom() that checks if the current size of the queue is less than the maximum size. It should return true if the size of the queue is less than the maximum size and false if it is equal to or greater than the maximum size.
3. Define another method .isEmpty() for Queue. This helper method should return true if the queue has no elements stored, (if the size of the queue is 0) or false if the queue has 1 or more elements.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Queue {
  // 1. adding a default parameter
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.size = 0;
    // 1.
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    this.queue.addToTail(data);
    this.size++;
    console.log(`Added ${data} to queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
  }

  dequeue() {
    const data = this.queue.removeHead();
    this.size--;
    console.log(`Removed ${data} from queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
    return data;
  }
  // 2.
  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }
  // 3.
  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;
```

## Avoiding Underflow
There are two conditions when enqueuing and dequeuing that we should be aware of and avoid: underflow and overflow.

Underflow occurs when we try to remove elements from an already empty queue – we cannot remove a node if it doesn’t exist. Underflow affects queues whether they are bounded or unbounded.

Let’s add code that will check for underflow when we attempt to dequeue.

### Exercises
1. Let’s add logic inside of .dequeue() that will help us to avoid underflow.

    Inside of the .dequeue() method, add code that checks if the queue is empty.
2. If the queue isn’t empty, the head node should be removed and the size of the queue should decrease. We will also log a message if the dequeue was successful.

    Move the code inside .dequeue() that already does this into the if clause you added.
3. If the queue is empty, we should let the user know we cannot dequeue a node with an error message.

    Add an else branch with code that throws an error with the message Queue is empty!.
4. Watch your code in action. Uncomment the bounded queue at the bottom of the file.

    Dequeue as many nodes as you can from boundedQueue, reading any messages that appear in the terminal including errors.
```JS
const LinkedList = require("./LinkedList");

class Queue {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }

  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    this.queue.addToTail(data);
    this.size++;
    console.log(`Added ${data} to queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
  }

  dequeue() {
    // 1. & 3.
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new Error('Queue is empty!');
    // Keeping code as it was, using shortcircuit method
    const data = this.queue.removeHead();
    this.size--;
    console.log(`Removed ${data} from queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
    return data;
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;

// 4.
const boundedQueue = new Queue(3);
boundedQueue.enqueue(1);
boundedQueue.enqueue(2);
boundedQueue.enqueue(3);
```
```
Added 1 to queue! Queue size is now 1.
Added 2 to queue! Queue size is now 2.
Added 3 to queue! Queue size is now 3.
```

## Avoiding Overflow
Overflow occurs when we add an element to a queue that does not have room for a new node.

This condition affects bounded queues because they have fixed sizes they cannot exceed. For unbounded queues, though they don’t have a size restriction, at some point the size of the queue will exceed the available memory we can use to store this queue.

We’ll be adding code to our Queue class to check for overflow whenever we try to add a node to a queue.

### Exercises
1. Let’s add logic inside of .enqueue() to help us avoid overflow.

    Inside of the .enqueue() method, add code that checks if there is room in the queue to add a new node.
2. If there is room in the queue, a new node should be added to the tail end of the queue and increasing its size. We’ll also log a message if successful.

    Move the code in .enqueue() that does this into the if clause.
3. If there isn’t room in the queue to add a node, we should let the user know with an error message.

    Add an else branch and add code that throws a new Error with the message Queue is full!.
4. Watch your code in action. Uncomment the bounded queue at the bottom of the file.

    Enqueue as many nodes as you can to boundedQueue, reading any messages that appear in the terminal including errors.

    Dequeue as many nodes as you can from boundedQueue, reading any messages that appear in the terminal including errors.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Queue {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }

  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    // 1. & 3.
    if (!this.hasRoom()) throw new Error('Queue is full!');
    // Keeping code as it was, using shortcircuit method
    this.queue.addToTail(data);
    this.size++;
    console.log(`Added ${data} to queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      const data = this.queue.removeHead();
      this.size--;
      console.log(`Removed ${data} from queue! Queue size is now ${this.size}.`);
      return data;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Queue is empty!");
    }
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;

// 4.
const boundedQueue = new Queue(3);

boundedQueue.enqueue(1);
boundedQueue.enqueue(2);
boundedQueue.enqueue(3);

boundedQueue.dequeue();
boundedQueue.dequeue();
boundedQueue.dequeue();
boundedQueue.dequeue();
```
```
Added 1 to queue! Queue size is now 1.
Added 2 to queue! Queue size is now 2.
Added 3 to queue! Queue size is now 3.
Removed 1 from queue! Queue size is now 2.
Removed 2 from queue! Queue size is now 1.
Removed 3 from queue! Queue size is now 0.
/home/ccuser/workspace/learn-queues-javascript-queue-conditions-avoiding-overflow/Queue.js:34
      throw new Error("Queue is empty!");

Error: Queue is empty!
```

## Review: Queues in JavaScript
Great work! You have just implemented a queue data structure in JavaScript by creating a Queue class that:
* follows FIFO protocol with .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods
* gives you the option of creating bounded queues with a .maxSize property
* prevents queue overflow and underflow by keeping track of the queue size

Let’s review by putting what you learned into practice.

### Exercises
`Queue.js`
```JS
const LinkedList = require("./LinkedList");

class Queue {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.queue = new LinkedList();
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }

  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }

  enqueue(data) {
    if (this.hasRoom()) {
      this.queue.addToTail(data);
      this.size++;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Queue is full!");
    }
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (!this.isEmpty()) {
      const data = this.queue.removeHead();
      this.size--;
      return data;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Queue is empty!");
    }
  }
}

module.exports = Queue;
```
`script.js`
```JS
const runway = require('./runway');

const flights = [
  'Botswana Bird flight #345',
  'Singapore Skies flight #890',
  'Mexico Mirage flight #234',
  'Greenland Flying Seals flight #567'
];

// Enqueue runway with planes
const departing = runway.load(flights);
// Clear each plane to takeoff
runway.clear(departing);
```
1. Let’s create and interact with queues made with our Queue class.

    We want to create a program in script.js using a library of functions in the runway.js file. The program will help the air traffic control at Codecademy International Airport move planes to the runway and allow those planes to take off in a FIFO order. At the moment this program doesn’t work, so let’s fix it by adding code to the functions in runway.js to finish our program.

    Inside of load() create a constant called runway and assign it a bounded queue with a maximum size of 3. This will hold all the planes waiting to be airborne. At the bottom of load(), return runway.
2. Inside .forEach(), enqueue each flight onto the runway.
3. Add error handling to load().

    Inside the .forEach() loop, add code to .load() that tries to log a message after each .enqueue(). Use the following to log a success message:
    ```JS
    console.log(`${flight} taxi to runway.`);
    ```

    Otherwise, catch the error and use the following to log a message if enqueuing fails:
    ```JS
    console.log('Runway full!');
    ```
4. Dequeue flights from the runway.

    clear() is a function that takes a full runway as an argument and removes each plane that takes off. Find the while loop in clear().

    Declare a constant called cleared before the two console.log statements. It should store the dequeued head of the runway passed to clear().
5. If the runway isn’t empty, it should allow each plane to take off until there are no more waiting planes on the runway.

    Change the condition in the while loop of clear() so that the loop only runs while there are planes on the runway. Use one of the Queue methods to check for this condition.
6. Check your work.

    Click on the tab in the text editor for the script.js file. Run the code and read the messages that are logged in the terminal.

    Congrats on finishing your first program using queues!

`runway.js`
```JS
const Queue = require('./Queue');

const load = flights => {
  // 1.
  const runway = new Queue(3);
  flights.forEach(flight => {
    // 3.
    try {
      // 2.
      runway.enqueue(flight);
      console.log(`${flight} taxi to runway.`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Runway full!');
    };
  });
  // 1.
  return runway;
};

const clear = runway => {
  // 5.
  while(!runway.isEmpty()) {
    // 4.
    const cleared = runway.dequeue();
    console.log('\nFlights wait...\n');
    console.log(`${cleared}, is cleared for takeoff!\n${cleared} in air.`);
  }

  console.log('\nAll planes took off, runway clear.');
};

module.exports = { load, clear };
```
```
Botswana Bird flight #345 taxi to runway.
Singapore Skies flight #890 taxi to runway.
Mexico Mirage flight #234 taxi to runway.
Runway full!

Flights wait...

Botswana Bird flight #345, is cleared for takeoff!
Botswana Bird flight #345 in air.

Flights wait...

Singapore Skies flight #890, is cleared for takeoff!
Singapore Skies flight #890 in air.

Flights wait...

Mexico Mirage flight #234, is cleared for takeoff!
Mexico Mirage flight #234 in air.

All planes took off, runway clear.
```
