# Stacks
# Learn Stacks: JavaScript

## Introduction
You have an understanding of how stacks work in theory, so now let’s see how they can be useful out in the wild — with Javascript!

Remember that there are three main methods that we want our stacks to have:
* Push - adds data to the top of the stack
* Pop - provides and removes data from the top of the stack
* Peek - provides data from the top of the stack without removing it

We also need to consider the stack’s size and tweak our methods a bit so that our stack does not overflow.

Let’s get started building out our Stack class.

### Exercises
`Node.js`
```JS
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }

  setNextNode(node) {
    if (!(node instanceof Node)) {
      throw new Error('Next node must be a member of the Node class');
    }
    this.next = node;
  }

  setNext(data) {
    this.next = data;
  }

  getNextNode() {
    return this.next;
  }
}

module.exports = Node;
```
`LinkedList.js`
```JS
const Node = require('./Node');

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  addToHead(value) {
    const nextNode = new Node(value);
    const currentHead = this.head;
    this.head = nextNode;
    if (currentHead) {
      this.head.setNextNode(currentHead);
    }
  }

  addToTail(value) {
    let lastNode = this.head;
    if (!lastNode) {
      this.head = new Node(value);
    } else {
      let temp = this.head;
      while (temp.getNextNode() !== null) {
        temp = temp.getNextNode();
      }
      temp.setNextNode(new Node(value));
    }
  }

  removeHead() {
    const removedHead = this.head;
    if (!removedHead) return;

    if (removedHead.next) {
      this.head = removedHead.next;
    }
    return removedHead.data;
  }

}

module.exports = LinkedList;
```
1. In Stack.js, an empty Stack class has been created for you. Inside the .constructor() method, instantiate the .stack property with a construction of a new LinkedList class that has been imported for you.
2. Below .constructor(), define another method .peek() that returns the data assigned to the stack’s top element. Remember that stack is a LinkedList instance that is made up of Node instances. The LinkedList class has a head property pointing to a Node instance. To access data, you first have to get to the head property.
`Stack.js`
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    // 1.
    this.stack = new LinkedList();
  }
  // 2.
  peek() {
    return this.stack.head.data;
  }
}

module.exports = Stack;
```

## Push and Pop
The stack’s .push() and .pop() methods are our tools to add and remove items from it. .pop() additionally returns the value of the item it is removing. Keep in mind that we can only make modifications to the top of the stack.

### Exercises
1. Below .constructor(), define a method .push() for Stack that takes the parameter value. Inside .push(), use a LinkedList method to add a new value to the head of this.stack.
2. Below .push(), define a .pop() method for Stack. Inside .pop():
    * figure out which of the LinkedList class methods will remove the head of the list and return its value.
    * create a const variable value and set it equal to the removed value.
    * return the value.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = new LinkedList();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.stack.head.data;
  }
  // 1.
  push(value) {
    this.stack.addToHead(value);
  }
  // 2.
  pop() {
    const value = this.stack.removeHead();
    return value;
  }
}

module.exports = Stack;
```

## Size I
With stacks, size matters. If we’re not careful, we can accidentally over-fill them with data. Since we don’t want any stack overflow, we need to go back and make a few modifications to our methods that help us track and limit the stack size so we can keep our stacks healthy.

What do we do if someone tries to .peek() or .pop() when our stack is empty?

How do we keep someone from .push()ing to a stack that has already reached its limit?

How do we even know how large our stack has gotten?

### Exercises
1. Let’s begin tracking the size of our stack. In .constructor(), we’ll add a new property size and initialize it to 0.
2. In the same .constructor(), let’s add:
    * a parameter maxSize with a default value of Infinity so that the stack is unlimited unless we define a size for it upon instantiation later.
    * a property .maxSize and initialize it to the parameter of the same name.
3. Let’s make sure that .peek() returns a valid value when it is not empty. In .peek(), wrap the current body with an if statement that checks if the size of the stack is greater than 0.
4. If the stack is empty, we need to return null instead. In .peek() outside the if statement, add an else statement to accomplish this.
5. Similarly in .pop(), we want to check if the stack is empty before returning a value. Wrap the current body in an if statement that checks if the size of the stack is greater than 0.
6. In .pop(), just before the return statement, reduce the size of the stack by 1.
7. If the Stack is empty, we want to let the user know with a message. Add an else statement that logs a message 'Stack is empty.'.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Stack {
  // 2. Adding default parameter
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.stack = new LinkedList();
    // 1.
    this.size = 0;
    // 2.
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
  }

  push(value) {
    this.stack.addToHead(value);
  }

  pop() {
    // 5.
    if (this.size > 0) {
      const value = this.stack.removeHead();
      // 6.
      this.size--;
      return value;
    } else {
      // 7.
      console.log('Stack is empty.');
    };
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.size > 0) {
      return this.stack.head.data;
    } else {
      // 4.
      return null;
    };
  }

};

module.exports = Stack;
```

## Size II
It’s time to add a couple helper methods.

Helper methods simplify the code we’ve written by abstracting and labeling chunks of code into a new function.

First, we want one that checks if our stack has room for more items. We can use this in .push() to guard against pushing items to our stack when it’s full.

Second, it’s helpful to have a method that checks if the stack is empty…

### Exercises
1. Define a new method .hasRoom() in Stack. The method should return true if its current size is less than its maximum size, otherwise false.
2. Go back to your .push() method — we need to make sure we’re keeping track of our stack size when we add new items. At the end of your method body, increment this.size by 1.
3. Now add a conditional statement at the top of .push() that checks if your stack has room (using your newly created helper method).
    * If there’s room, the rest of the body of the method should execute
    * If there’s no room, we want to throw an Error() letting users know that the stack is already full with a message of 'Stack is full'.
4. Finally, let’s define a new method .isEmpty() in Stack.

    The method should return true if the stack’s size is 0 and false otherwise.
5. Now we can use our .isEmpty() method in our class. Rewrite your .pop() and .peek() methods to use .isEmpty() in their conditionals.
```JS
const LinkedList = require('./LinkedList');

class Stack {
  constructor(maxSize = Infinity) {
    this.stack = new LinkedList();
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  push(value) {
    // 3.
    if (!this.hasRoom()) throw new Error('Stack is full!');
    this.stack.addToHead(value);
    // 2.
    this.size++;
  }

  pop() {
    // 5.
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      const value = this.stack.removeHead();
      this.size--;
      return value;
    }
    else {
      console.log('Stack is empty!');
    }
  }

  peek() {
    // 5.
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return this.stack.head.data;
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
  // 1.
  hasRoom() {
    return this.size < this.maxSize;
  }
  // 4.
  isEmpty() {
    return this.size === 0;
  }
}

module.exports = Stack;
```

## Review
Nice work — you’ve built out a Stack class that can:
* add a new item to the top via a .push() method
* remove an item from the top and returns its value with a .pop() method
* return the value of the top item using a .peek() method
* allow a stack instance to maintain an awareness of its size to prevent stack overflow.

So how does your code stack up against pizza delivery?

### Exercises
1. In main.js file, instantiate a Stack class with a size of 6 and assign it to a variable pizzaStack using the const keyword.
2. Use a for loop to push six pizzas to pizzaStack, naming each pizza 'Pizza #n' where n is from 1 to 6.
3. Try adding ‘Pizza #7’ to pizzaStack to see if the program will throw any error. Add this code inside a try and catch block.
4. Before we deliver our pizzas, let’s take a peek at which pizza is at the top of the stack. Log a message The first pizza to deliver is followed by the value of the top pizza.
5. We are ready to deliver the pizzas off our stack. Deliver all the pizzas from the stack from top down. Which method would you use to do so?
6. Is the pizza stack now empty? Try removing one more pizza off the stack. Catch any error that might be thrown. Do this in a try and catch block.

`main.js`
```JS
const Stack = require('./Stack');

// 1. Define an empty pizza stack with a maxSize of 6
const pizzaStack = new Stack(6);
// 2. Add pizzas as they are ready until we fill up the stack
for (let n = 1; n < 7; n++) {
  pizzaStack.push(`Pizza #${n}`);
};
// 3. Try pushing another pizza to check for overflow
try {
  pizzaStack.push('Pizza #7');
} catch(e) {
  console.log(e.message);
};

// 4. Peek at the pizza on the top of stack and log its value
console.log(`The first pizza to deliver is ${pizzaStack.peek()}`);

// 5. Deliver all the pizzas from the top of the stack down
for (let n = 0; n < 6; n++) {
  pizzaStack.pop();
};

// 6. Try popping another pizza to check for empty stack
try {
  pizzaStack.pop();
} catch(e) {
  console.log(e.message);
};
```
```
Stack is full
The first pizza to deliver is Pizza #6
Stack is empty
```
