# Password Authentication

# Passport.js Local Authentication

## Introduction to Passport.js
Passport.js is a flexible authentication middleware for Node.js that can be added to any Express-based application. With Passport.js we can implement authentication using the concept of strategies.

Passport strategies are separate modules created to work with different means of authentication. Passport is a very extensible middleware, and it allows you to plug in over 300 different authentication providers like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and more.

In order to offer Passport-supported authentication, we’ll need to install and configure the strategies modules that we’d like to use. In this lesson, we’ll be focusing on a local Passport strategy, passport-local, and authenticating users using a username and password.

We can take a look at the diagram to get an understanding of the authentication flow through Passport.js, and we’ll go more in-depth as to how each step works in the following exercises.

## Configuring Passport.js
One of the great things about using Passport.js is that a lot of the heavy lifting is taken care of by the module. In order to use it, we need to configure it and implement cookies and sessions for persistent logins.

To start using the traditional authentication module, we install the passport and the passport-local packages via the terminal:
```
npm install passport passport-local
```

Once imported, we require the passport and passport-local packages in our JavaScript file:
```JS
const passport = require("passport");
const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;
```

We’re importing the passport-local package with its Strategy instance to authenticate users with a username and password.

Now that we have the package installed, we can initialize it by calling the initialize() method:
```JS
app.use(passport.initialize());
```

passport is a middleware and must be implemented using app.use(). The initialize() method initializes the authentication module across our app.

Next, we want to allow for persistent logins, and we can do this by calling session() on our passport module:
```JS
app.use(passport.session());
```

The session() middleware alters the request object and is able to attach a ‘user’ value that can be retrieved from the session id.

### Exercies
1. Import the passport library and store it in a const variable called passport at the top of the app.js file.
2. Import the passport-local library with its Strategy module and store it in a const variable called LocalStrategy.
3. Add the middleware necessary to initialize the passport library.
4. Add the middleware to implement a session with passport.

```JS
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
// 1. Import the passport library below:
const passport = require('passport');
// 2. Import the passport-local library below:
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

const session = require("express-session");
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "secret-key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);

// 3. Add the middleware to initialize the passport library below:
app.use(passport.initialize());

// 4. Add the middleware to implement a session with passport below:
app.use(passport.session());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello from the homepage!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Passport's Local Strategy
With Passport configured, we can now set up the passport-local strategy for authenticating with a username and password.

First, we can configure the local strategy by creating a new instance of it and passing it as middleware into passport:
```JS
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
  function(username, password, done) {
    // …
  }
));
```

The new LocalStrategy object will take in an anonymous function with the following parameters:
* username
* password
* A callback function called done.

The purpose of the done callback is to supply an authenticated user to Passport if a user is authenticated. The logic within the anonymous function follows this order:
1. Verify login details in the callback function.
2. If login details are valid, the done callback function is invoked and the user is authenticated.
3. If the user is not authenticated, pass false into the callback function.

The done callback function takes in two arguments:
* An error or null if no error is found.
* A user or false if no user is found.

With those steps implemented our updated strategy should look like:
```JS
passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
  function (username, password, done) {
    // Look up user in the db
    db.users.findByUsername(username, (err, user) => {
      // If there's an error in db lookup, 
      // return err callback function
      if(err) return done(err);
 
      // If user not found, 
      // return null and false in callback
      if(!user) return done(null, false);
 
      // If user found, but password not valid, 
      // return err and false in callback
      if(user.password != password) return done(null, false);
 
      // If user found and password valid, 
      // return the user object in callback
      return done(null, user)
    });
  })
);
```

We’re looking for potential errors during the authentication process and addressing them before the next request handler is reached.

Once the local strategy is configured, the Express application will have user authentication implemented!

## Serializing and Deserializing Users
If authentication succeeds, a session will be established and maintained via a cookie set in the user’s browser. However, if a user logs in and refreshes the page, the user data won’t persist across HTTP requests. We can fix this by serializing and deserializing users.

Serializing a user determines which data of the user object should be stored in the session, usually the user id. The serializeUser() function sets an id as the cookie in the user’s browser, and the deserializeUser() function uses the id to look up the user in the database and retrieve the user object with data.

When we serialize a user, Passport takes that user id and stores it internally on req.session.passport which is Passport’s internal mechanism to keep track of things.
```JS
passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user.id);
});
```

In the code example, we pass a user object and a callback function called done after successful authentication.

The first argument in the done() function is an error object. In this case, since there was no error we pass null as the argument. For the second argument, we pass in the value that we want to store in our Passport’s internal session, the user id. Once configured, the user id will then be stored in Passport’s internal session:
```JS
req.session.passport.user = {id: 'xyz'}
```

For any subsequent request, the user object can be retrieved from the session via the deserializeUser() function. We can implement the deserializeUser function as follows:
```JS
passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
  // Look up user id in database. 
  db.users.findById(id, function (err, user) {
    if (err) return done(err); 
    done(null, user);
  });
});
```

For the deserializeUser function, we pass the key that was used when we initially serialized a user (id). The id is used to look up the user in storage, and the fetched object is attached to the request object as req.user across our whole application.

This way we’re able to access the logged-in user’s data in req.user on every subsequent request!

## Logging In
In this exercise, we’ll take a look at the endpoints to log in a user.

In order to log in a user we first need a POST request that takes in user credentials. We can add passport middleware in order to process the authentication and, if successful, serialize the user for us:
```JS
app.post("/login",
  passport.authenticate("insertStrategyHere", { failureRedirect : "/insertPathHere"}),
  (req, res) => {
    res.redirect("profile");
  }
);
```

We’re passing in passport.authenticate() as middleware. Using this middleware allows Passport.js to take care of the authentication process behind the scenes and creates a user session for us.

passport.authenticate() takes in:
* A string specifying which strategy to employ. In this case, we should use a local strategy.
* An optional object as the second argument. In this case, we should set the failureRedirect key to "/login". This will redirect the user to the /login page if the login process fails.

Once implemented, we can update the "/profile" endpoint to make use of the serialized user found in the request object, req.user:
```JS
app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  res.render("insertDashboardNameHere", { user: req.user });
});
```

This will render our profile view page along with the user data stored in the session!

### Exercises
1. A POST request to log in has been provided, app.post("/login"...), but it’s missing the Passport middleware. Add the proper middleware to authenticate a user.
2. Provide the right parameters to authenticate a user and redirect them to the "/login" page if login is not successful.
    
    The first parameter provided to passport is the strategy you’re using. To redirect a user, you can provide an object as a second parameter with local as the key and the path redirect as the value `”/login”:
    ```JS
    passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" })
    ```
3. Update the "/profile“ endpoint to pass in the user object found in the request object.

    Once a user is serialized the user will be stored in req.user.

    From there, data can be passed into a view page as an object:
    ```JS
    app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
      // Pass user object stored in session to the view page:
      res.render("profile", { user: req.user});
      res.render("profile");
    });
    ```

```JS
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const session = require("express-session");
const store = new session.MemoryStore();
const passport = require("passport");
const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;
const db = require("./db");
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4001;

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));

app.use(
  session({
    secret: "secret-key",
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store,
  })
);

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user.id);
});

passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
  // Look up user id in database.
  db.users.findById(id, function (err, user) {
    if (err) {
      return done(err);
    }
    done(null, user);
  });
});

passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(function (username, password, cb) {
    db.users.findByUsername(username, function (err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return cb(err);
      }
      if (!user) {
        return cb(null, false);
      }
      if (user.password != password) {
        return cb(null, false);
      }
      return cb(null, user);
    });
  })
);

app.get("/login", (req, res) => {
  res.render("login");
});

app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  // 3. Pass user object stored in session to the view page:
  res.render("profile", { user: req.user });
});

// 1. Add the passport middleware below:
// 2. Add parameters into passport middleware
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login'}),
  (req, res) => {
    res.redirect("profile");
  }
);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## User Registration I
Let’s learn how to register a user without a database. In a real production environment, you should use a database, but we’ve simplified this example to focus on the creation of new users.

Instead of a database, we’ll use an array holding data:
```JS
// users:
let records = [
  {
    id: 1,
    username: "sam",
    password: "codec@demy10",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    username: "jill",
    password: "p@ssword123!",
  },
];
```

Using a custom helper function we created in users.js, we can retrieve user data upon registration and update the records array:
```JS
function createUser(user) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const newUser = {
      // getNewId creates an updated ID 
      // for the new user
      id: getNewId(records),
      ...user,
    };
    records = [newUser, ...records];
    resolve(newUser);
  });
};
```

In the createUser() function, we’re creating a Promise in order to prevent events from becoming blocked when running the application.

createUser() creates a new user and inserts them into our database, records. Once created, we resolve the Promise and send back the newly created user. If you need a refresher on promises, take a look at our [Promises cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript/modules/javascript-promises/cheatsheet) for a quick overview.

NOTE: Since we’re not making use of a database, the newly created user will not be persisted if the server restarts.

## User Registration II
Let’s use the createUser() helper function in our routes. We’ll add the logic to create users in a POST request to "/register".

Since we’re working with promises, we can create an asynchronous route handler by using async/await:
```JS
app.post("/register", async (req, res) => { ... })
```

We’ll retrieve the user data from req.body and await as we call our helper function to create the new user:
```JS
app.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // imported helper function: 
  // db.users.createUser
  const newUser = await db.users.createUser({ username, password });
```

If a newUser is successfully created, we send a status code of 201 and a json response back to the client:
```JS
app.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = await db.users.createUser({ username, password });
  if (newUser) {
    res.status(201).json({
      msg: "Insert Success Message Here",
      insertDataHere
    });
  }
```

Lastly, we want to handle potential errors that might occur. In an else statement we can return a status code of 500 indicating that there was a relevant error message:
```JS
app.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = await db.users.createUser({ username, password });
  if (newUser) {
    res.status(201).json({
      msg: "Insert Success Message Here",
      insertDataHere
    });
  } else {
    res.status(500).json({ msg: "Insert Failure Message Here" });
  }
```

NOTE: In a real development environment, passwords would be hashed whenever a new user registers.

With the route completed, users will now be able to register and log in!
