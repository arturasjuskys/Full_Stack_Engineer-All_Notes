# What is primary vs secondary navigation?
* The primary navigation system typically contains the most important links and buttons that need to be displayed on every single page of the site.
* Secondary navigation, or breadcrumb navigation, usually consists of a clickable list of pages or attributes that led to the current page. It can help users understand the extent of the site and also where they are currently.

For example, a shopping site may have a breadcrumb trail leading to a pair of shoes like so:
