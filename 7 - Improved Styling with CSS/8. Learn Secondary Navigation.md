# What is primary vs secondary navigation?
* The primary navigation system typically contains the most important links and buttons that need to be displayed on every single page of the site.
* Secondary navigation, or breadcrumb navigation, usually consists of a clickable list of pages or attributes that led to the current page. It can help users understand the extent of the site and also where they are currently.

For example, a shopping site may have a breadcrumb trail leading to a pair of shoes like so:

# Simple Example of Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs are usually displayed as a horizontal list of pages and take up minimal space. Users expect to find them in the header, left-aligned, and below any primary navigation. Typically they are separated with a “>” or a “/“ symbol.

To add “>” or a “/“ symbol programmatically
* The + is called the adjacent sibling combinator; it will only select two li‘s when they are immediately next to each other, with the same parent. The element that actually gets selected is the second element of this sibling pair.
* The ::before part of this selector creates a pseudo-element. The ::before pseudo-element is often used with the content property, to add content that will be displayed just before the selected element.
