# Representing a Schema with Entity Relationship Diagrams

## What is a schema?
When designing a database, the most common thing seen among most teams will be a database schema. Database schemas are often drawn as diagrams — big pictures showing every table and how they are connected. These schemas will usually include the columns in each database and arrows showing how a table relates to another table. There are a few different ways to draw out these diagrams, but in this article, we’ll cover an Entity Relationship Diagram, which is a slightly higher level than a basic database schema.

## Why use a schema?
When working with a database, especially larger databases, it can become very difficult to track each relation within the database due to the size and scope of the database. To assist in keeping track of the database, a schema can be used to help visualize the database and all of its relations. These schemas can be as simple as just naming each table and drawing a line to each connected table. An example of a simple database schema can be seen below.

## What’s an Entity Relationship Diagram?
An Entity Relationship Diagram, or ERD, is a method of diagramming a database with a little more description put into it to allow a designer to better understand the database and the relationships between the tables. This is done by using several different items within the schema. Including:
* Entities. Entities are usually represented as rectangles and indicate the table’s name.
* Attributes. Attributes can be found in one of two places, either inside of the entity’s rectangles as rows or outside of the entity represented by an oval that is connected to the entity. In both places, an attribute means the same thing and is the individual columns that will be found within that table or entity.
* Actions. Actions are seen as diamonds within the ERD and describe the relationships between different entities. For instance, if we have two entities, a Customer and a Credit Card that are both connected, we can put an action in between those two that says “has” to show the designer that a Customer has a Credit Card.
* Connecting Lines. These lines, just like in a basic schema, are used to show the connection between each entity, action, and attribute.

An example of an entity-relationship diagram can be seen below. Notice that the connecting lines have special symbols on the ends, this will be talked about in more detail later.

## Connecting Lines in More Detail
Let’s look at some of the different ways you can use lines to represent relationships between entities. We can represent the cardinality of entities by using symbols on the lines connecting the entities. Using these symbols, we can represent relationships such as many to many, many to one, one to one, and so forth.

The only complication that comes from cardinality is that several different styles currently exist to display these relationships, including Information Engineering Style, Chen Style, Bachman Style, and more. These different styles all still represent the same information, and can be learned about more [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams#section_5).

## How To Create a Schema
When building a schema, there are several tools available to help ensure that you can create a clean-looking schema. The first option we’ll look at is just a simple hand-drawn schema. While a hand-drawn schema will be easier with simpler schemas, nothing is stopping us from drawing these schemas on a piece of notebook paper or a whiteboard in a meeting room. Once drawn we can take a picture of the schema and email it, save it, or start translating it into a web-designed schema.

A web designed schema is a schema designed on the web. There is a large variety of different tools available to start creating schemas online, and it’s all a matter of personal preference for which one to use. At the end of the day, someone could even make a schema using paint on Windows. Some online tools to help build a schema online can be seen below.
* [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home). This website helps with designing ERDs while also providing a script to help create the database.
* [dbdesigner.net](https://www.dbdesigner.net/). This online design tool allows us to create diagram schemas with simple tools while also creating a script for database creation in several different languages.
* [lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/database-design-tool). This website allows us to create database schemas with the same tools used to create different charts. A large amount of freedom lets us create highly detailed database schemas while also providing an export option to several different database options.

One thing to keep in mind when designing the schema is to try and keep the schema as organized as possible. Especially in larger databases, there can be a large number of tables all connected in different ways. When this happens, make sure that each connecting line is fully visible, easy to follow, and doesn’t intersect with other lines. Make sure that all the columns are labeled correctly in the table you expect them to go into once the database is built. Outside of those few practices, the user has general freedom when designing the schema and can generally do whatever needs to be done to show what the database would look like.

## Other Schema Types
While this article mainly looked at the ERD, there are still several different schema options available to use. Some being more complicated than others and some being less complicated. For example, some lower level schema types are the hierarchical model, the network model, and the relational model. Most schemas will use the relational model. If a higher level is needed than ERD we could use the star schema or the snowflake schema. These higher levels deal more with the design of the database and making it more efficient rather than trying to display more information about the schema.

The best choice when creating a schema is to use whatever you believe will be most effective. If working in a small team a simple schema with the tables and connecting lines might be enough as any questions about the diagram can easily be asked among members. But in larger workplaces an ERD can be useful to help convey more information within the schema, reducing the number of questions regarding the design of the database. In the end, it’s a matter of either personal choice or management choice in a career.
