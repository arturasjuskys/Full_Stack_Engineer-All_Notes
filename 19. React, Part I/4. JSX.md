# Intro to JSX

## What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML.

What does “syntax extension” mean?

In this case, it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it!

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

Codecademy’s servers already have a JSX compiler installed, so you don’t have to worry about that for now. Eventually we’ll walk through how to set up a JSX compiler on your personal computer.

## JSX Elements
A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:
```JS
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.

## JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array…you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:
```JS
const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
```

Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:
```JS
const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
```

## Attributes In JSX
JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:
```JS
my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
```

Here are some JSX elements with attributes:
```JS
<a href='http://www.example.com'>Welcome to the Web</a>;
 
const title = <h1 id='title'>Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>; 
```

A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:
```JS
const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px' />;
```

## Rendering JSX
You’ve learned how to write JSX elements! Now it’s time to learn how to render them.

To render a JSX expression means to make it appear onscreen.

```JS
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Passing a Variable to ReactDOM.render()
ReactDOM.render()‘s first argument should evaluate to a JSX expression, it doesn’t have to literally be a JSX expression.

The first argument could also be a variable, so long as that variable evaluates to a JSX expression.

In this example, we save a JSX expression as a variable named toDoList. We then pass toDoList as the first argument to ReactDOM.render():
```JS
const toDoList = (
  <ol>
    <li>Learn React</li>
    <li>Become a Developer</li>
  </ol>
);
 
ReactDOM.render(
  toDoList, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## The Virtual DOM
One special thing about ReactDOM.render() is that it only updates DOM elements that have changed.

That means that if you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing:
```JS
const hello = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
 
// This will add "Hello world" to the screen:
 
ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));
 
// This won't do anything at all:
 
ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));
```

This is significant! Only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful. React accomplishes this thanks to something called the virtual DOM.

## Variable Attributes in JSX
When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

Here’s an example of how that might work:
```JS
// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:
 
const sideLength = "200px";
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
);
```

Notice how in this example, the <img />‘s attributes each get their own line. This can make your code more readable if you have a lot of attributes on one element.

Object properties are also often used to set attributes:
```JS
const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5",
  owl: "http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3",
  owlCat: "http://bit.ly/1Upbczi"
}; 
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);
 
const owl = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owl} 
    alt="Unimpressed Owl" />
);
 
const owlCat = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owlCat} 
    alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
);
```

## Event Listeners in JSX
JSX elements can have event listeners, just like HTML elements can. Programming in React means constantly working with event listeners.

You create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute. Here’s an example:
```JS
<img onClick={myFunc} />
```

An event listener attribute’s name should be something like onClick or onMouseOver: the word on, plus the type of event that you’re listening for. You can see a list of valid event names here.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function. The above example would only work if myFunc were a valid function that had been defined elsewhere:
```JS
function myFunc() {
  alert('Make myFunc the pFunc... omg that was horrible i am so sorry');
}
 
<img onClick={myFunc} />
```

Note that in HTML, event listener names are written in all lowercase, such as onclick or onmouseover. In JSX, event listener names are written in camelCase, such as onClick or onMouseOver.

## JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Do Work
How can you write a conditional, if you can’t inject an if statement into JSX?

Well, one option is to write an if statement, and not inject it into JSX.

Look at if.js. Follow the if statement, all the way from line 6 down to line 18.

if.js works, because the words if and else are not injected in between JSX tags. The if statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary.

This is a common way to express conditionals in JSX.
```JS
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

let message;

if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  message, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator
There’s a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the ternary operator.

The ternary operator works the same way in React as it does in regular JavaScript. However, it shows up in React surprisingly often.

Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy.” If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z. Here’s a nice explanation if you need a refresher.

Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:
```JS
const headline = (
  <h1>
    { age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' }
  </h1>
);
```
In the above example, if age is greater than or equal to drinkingAge, then headline will equal `<h1>`Buy Drink`</h1>`. Otherwise, headline will equal `<h1>`Do Teen Stuff`</h1>`.

## JSX Conditionals: &&
We’re going to cover one final way of writing conditionals in React: the && operator.

Like the ternary operator, && is not React-specific, but it shows up in React surprisingly often.

In the last two lessons, you wrote statements that would sometimes render a kitty and other times render a doggy. && would not have been the best choice for those lessons.

&& works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, but other times do nothing at all.

Here’s an example:
```JS
const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
```

If the expression on the left of the && evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the && will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the && will 

## .map in JSX
The array method .map() comes up often in React. It’s good to get in the habit of using it alongside JSX.

If you want to create a list of JSX elements, then .map() is often your best bet. It can look odd at first:
```Js
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
 
const listItems = strings.map(string => <li>{string}</li>);
 
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

In the above example, we start out with an array of strings. We call .map() on this array of strings, and the .map() call returns a new array of `<li>`s.

On the last line of the example, note that {listItems} will evaluate to an array, because it’s the returned value of .map()! JSX `<li>`s don’t have to be in an array like this, but they can be.
```JS
// This is fine in JSX, not in an explicit array:
 
<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
</ul>
 
// This is also fine!
 
const liArray = [
  <li>item 1</li>, 
  <li>item 2</li>, 
  <li>item 3</li>
];
 
<ul>{liArray}</ul>
```

## Keys
When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called keys:
```JS
<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul>
```

A key is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s name is key. The attribute’s value should be something unique, similar to an id attribute.

keys don’t do anything that you can see! React uses them internally to keep track of lists. If you don’t use keys when you’re supposed to, React might accidentally scramble your list-items into the wrong order.

Not all lists need to have keys. A list needs keys if either of the following are true:

The list-items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.

A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.

If neither of these conditions are true, then you don’t have to worry about keys. If you aren’t sure then it never hurts to use them!

## React.createElement
You can write React code without using JSX at all!

The majority of React programmers do use JSX, and we will use it for the remainder of this tutorial, but you should understand that it is possible to write React code without it.

The following JSX expression:
```JS
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
```

can be rewritten without JSX, like this:
```JS
const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, world"
);
```

When a JSX element is compiled, the compiler transforms the JSX element into the method that you see above: React.createElement(). Every JSX element is secretly a call to React.createElement().

We won’t go in-depth into how React.createElement() works, but you can start with the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html) if you’d like to learn more!
