## Defining API design and why it matters
Building successful APIs is difficult. Apart from the various stakeholders (engineers, designers, etc.) and technology decisions, there are a lot of finer details that can get overlooked. One slip-up can result in endless support requests from end-users and eventually result in a bad reputation. It’s crucial to plan, plan, and plan even more before actually implementing an API. This is why API design, typically the first step in the API development lifecycle, is so important.

API design is defined as the iterative collection of decisions that lead to a concrete plan for developing, implementing, and maintaining an API. The design process is not just about the developers who are building the API but also about understanding the API’s end-user, their needs, and how best the API can meet those needs. There are notable benefits in investing time and resources into the design phase of the API development lifecycle. Some of the benefits include:
* Effective Implementation: A detailed API design can significantly help in the APIs implementation (usually by developers) phase by preventing ambiguity.
* Incremental Development: Having a straightforward design helps know precisely which resource, or sub-resources, would need to be updated (or retired), preventing confusion and leading to less duplicated work.
* Better Documentation: A solid initial API design makes documenting the API faster and less error-prone.

But how exactly do we know we have created a well-designed API? Let’s explore a few characteristics most well-designed APIs share.

## Characteristics of a Well-Designed API
Typically, a well-designed API will have the following characteristics:
* Easy to read and work with: A well-designed API will be easy to work with, and its resources and associated operations can quickly be memorized by developers who work with it regularly.
* Hard to misuse: Implementing and integrating with a well-designed API will be a straightforward process and less error-prone. It has informative feedback and doesn’t enforce strict guidelines on the API’s end-user.
* Complete and concise: A well-designed API is a complete API. This means the API exposes any data that the end-user expects it to expose. Most APIs are completed over a long period of time – implementing end-user feedback and releasing new versions along the way.
* Well documented: Finding any information about endpoints, integrations, and features should be simple with a well-designed API. The documentation will cover and explain all the available functionality of the API.
* Reliable: An API’s end-user will depend on an API to be available and functioning when they need it. They also expect functionality to not arbitrarily change without any proper notice.

But how do we make sure our APIs have these characteristics? Well, let’s go through some standard, applicable best practices to create and maintain a well-designed API. By doing so, we will see how small changes in our APIs design can help bring us closer to achieving the characteristics listed above.

Before we dive in, let’s imagine a hypothetical photo-sharing application. The application allows end-users to upload photos, characterizing them by the location of where the photos were taken. End-users can also hashtag the photo to describe the emotions associated with them. Keep this application in mind as we will explore the best practices of three distinct parts of an APIs design:
* Collections, Resources, and Their URLs
* Requests
* Responses

## Collections, Resources, and Their URLs
### Nouns are Your Best Friend
For any resource or collection that represents some data in an API, the base URL should always be neat, elegant, and, most importantly, intuitive. A long and difficult-to-read base URL is not just bad to look at but can also provide a more error-prone and challenging experience for the end-user. For example, let’s take a look at a set of potential URLs (and associated HTTP verbs) for our previously mentioned photo-sharing application:

| API Route | Purpose | HTTP Verb |
| - | - | - |
| /retrieveEveryPhoto | Retrieve all photos | GET |
| /getSinglePhoto/1 | Retrieve a single photo | GET |

While these API URLs might seem easy to comprehend, it’s easy to imagine our URLs getting very lengthy and confusing in the future. There is also no clear consistency between what and how each of the resources is called (ex. “get” vs. “retrieve”). This is why it is best to keep API URLs consistent by only using nouns. Here are the same API resources re-written with a single noun:

| API Route | Purpose | HTTP Verb |
| - | - | - |
| /photos | Retrieve all photos | GET |
| /photos/1 | Retrieve a single photo | GET |

There’s no hard rule on keeping the resource nouns singular or plural, though having the same plurality across all resources and collections helps achieve a level of consistency.

### Describe resource functionality with HTTP methods
Recall, RESTful APIs are comprised majorly of HTTP methods that have well-defined and unique actions for any resource. These methods help all APIs achieve a level of consistency in the type of operations end-users expect to occur when using an HTTP method. For example, here’s a list of commonly used HTTP methods that define the CRUD operations for any resource or collection in our photo-sharing app:

| HTTP Verb | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| GET | Retrieve a resource | GET | /photos/1 |
| POST | Add a resource | POST | /photos |
| PUT | Update a resource | PUT | /photos/34 |
| PATCH | Update a resource | PATCH | /photos/4 |
| DELETE | Delete a resource | DELETE | /photos/12 |

Mapping these HTTP methods to describe the typical CRUD operations of our applications allows developers to know exactly what they should expect to occur.

## Responses
### Give Feedback to Help Developers Succeed
Providing good feedback to developers on how well they are using an API goes a long way in improving adoption and retention. Good feedback involves positive validation on correct implementations and an informative error on incorrect implementations that can help developers debug and correct how they use the API.

For APIs, errors (and relevant error codes) are a great way to provide context when things go wrong! In general, there are three possible error outcomes when using an API:
1. The client application behaved erroneously (client error - 4xx response code)
2. The API behaved erroneously (server error - 5xx response code)
3. The client and API worked (success - 2xx response code)

When designing an API, describe these error responses well, but keep them concise and neat. In addition, use specific response codes to detail errors accordingly in the API ([check out this great resource on error codes](http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)). Lastly, provide enough information in the error codes for an end-user to start work on fixing the cause, and, if there’s more information needed, provide links to additional documentation.

## Requests
### Handle complex requests elegantly
An API should be able to access many different types of data, so we want to be mindful of organizing it to best help our end-user. We want to make sure that our data is complete, available, and accounts for relationships between different types of data. In the interest of performance, we’d only want to surface the relevant data that an end-user needs and even consider limiting the amount of data they get in the response.

We’ve already seen how we can retrieve individual resources (e.g. /photos/1) and a collection (e.g. /photos), but how can we add more complex behavior to our requests? One way to account for specific properties and limit responses is to use a query parameter, adding a ? with key-value pairs that list out what a user needs.

Let’s take the example of our photo-sharing app. Someone might want to get photos from a specific location and a specific hashtag. We might also want to limit the number of results to 10 per API call to prevent server load. If the user wants to find the top 10 photos in Boston with a hashtag #winter, the call would be:
```
GET /photos?location=boston&hashtag=winter&limit=10
```

Notice how the complexities have now been reduced to a simple association with a query parameter. These are just some of the ways we could design parameters that strive towards API completion and help our end developers use our API intuitively.

Also, when in doubt, leave it out. Developing and maintaining APIs is a continuous process, so we can wait for feedback from our end-users to see how we can improve our API. This way, we account for the immediate and future needs of the API.

## Wrap up
To summarize, we learned:
* What API design is and the benefits of investing in it
* Common characteristics of a well-designed API
* Common best practices when approaching API resource naming, requests, and responses

There isn’t a single approach to API design that will work for every individual or organization. The above suggestions are just that — advice and recommendations which can be used or discarded depending on our end-users needs.
