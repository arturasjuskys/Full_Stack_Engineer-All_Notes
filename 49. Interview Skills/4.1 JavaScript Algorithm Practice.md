# Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the oldest-known algorithms, and it’s still helpful for deriving prime numbers! The algorithm is attributed to Eratosthenes, a Greek mathemetician born in the third century BCE.

The sieve provides a set of steps for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. In this article, we’ll cover implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes in JavaScript. As a reminder, a prime number is a positive number with no divisors but 1 and itself. 2, 3, 11, and 443 are all prime numbers.

## Sieve Implementation

The sieve works by first assuming that all numbers from

{2,…,n}

are prime, and then successively marking them as NOT prime.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Create a list of all integers from 2 to n.
2. Start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number).
3. Mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime.
4. Move to the next non-marked number and repeat this process until the entire list has been covered.

When the steps are complete, all remaining non-marked numbers are prime.
