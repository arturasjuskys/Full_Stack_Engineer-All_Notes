# Function Components

## Stateless Functional Components
In the code editor, take a look at Example.js. The first Example component is defined as a JavaScript class, but it doesn’t have to be! In React, we can also define components as JavaScript functions — we call them function components to differentiate them from class components.

In the latest versions of React, function components can do everything that class components can do. In most cases, however, function components offer a more elegant, concise way of creating React components. This lesson will focus on converting a class component to a function component and adding props, which are available in all versions of React.

Compare the Example class component and the Example function component. For the most basic function components, all you need to do is remove the beginning render() { and ending } of the render() method:
```Js
render() { // Delete this
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
} // Delete this
```
To put it in other words: the function component should return the same JSX that was originally returned by the render() method.
```JS
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

export const Friend = () => {
  return <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-octopus.jpg" />
}

ReactDOM.render(
	<Friend />,
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Function Components and Props
Like any component, function components can receive information via props.

To access these props, give your function component a parameter named props. Within the function body, you can access the props using this pattern: props.propertyName. You don’t need to use the this keyword.
```JS
export function YesNoQuestion (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{props.prompt}</p>
      <input value="Yes" />
      <input value="No" />
    </div>
  );
}
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <YesNoQuestion prompt="Have you eaten an apple today?" />,
  document.getElementById('app');
);
```

In the above example, we pass a value of “Have you eaten an apple today?” as the prompt prop when rendering YesNoQuestion.


## Review
Well done! You’ve written your first function component. Here’s a recap:
* Function components are React components defined as JavaScript functions
* Function components must return JSX
* Function components may accept a props parameter. Expect it to be a JavaScript object

Although function components and class components can do the same things, you’ll see a lot of function components in the React documentation and example apps. Some developers prefer them over class components for their simplicity and straightforward features, like Hooks, which you’ll learn later in your coding journey.

# The State Hook

## Why Use Hooks?
As React developers, we love breaking down complex problems into simple pieces.

Classes, however, are not simple. They:
* are difficult to reuse between components
* are tricky and time-consuming to test
* have confused many developers and caused lots of bugs

The React core team heard all of this feedback from developers like us, and they engineered an incredible solution for us! React 16.8+ supports Hooks. With Hooks, we can use simple function components to do lots of the fancy things that we could only do with class components in the past.

React Hooks, plainly put, are functions that let us manage the internal state of components and handle post-rendering side effects directly from our function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let us use fancy React features without classes. Keep in mind that function components and React Hooks do not replace class components. They are completely optional; just a new tool that we can take advantage of.

Note: If you’re familiar with [lifecycle methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class) of class components, you could say that Hooks let us “hook into” state and lifecycle features directly from our function components.

React offers a number of built-in Hooks. A few of these include useState(), useEffect(), useContext(), useReducer(), and useRef(). See [the full list in the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). In this lesson, we’ll learn different ways to manage state in a function component.

## Update Function Component State
Let’s get started with the State Hook, the most common Hook used for building React components. The State Hook is a named export from the React library, so we import it like this:
```JS
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
useState() is a JavaScript function defined in the React library. When we call this function, it returns an array with two values:
* current state - the current value of this state
* state setter - a function that we can use to update the value of this state

Because React returns these two values in an array, we can assign them to local variables, naming them whatever we like. For example:
```JS
const [toggle, setToggle] = useState();
```

Let’s have a look at an example of a function component using the State Hook:
```JS
import React, { useState } from "react";
 
function Toggle() {
  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState();
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The toggle is {toggle}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setToggle("On")}>On</button>
      <button onClick={() => setToggle("Off")}>Off</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how the state setter function, setToggle(), is called by our onClick event listeners. To update the value of toggle and re-render this component with the new value, all we need to do is call the setToggle() function with the next state value as an argument.

No need to worry about binding functions to class instances, working with constructors, or dealing with the this keyword. With the State Hook, updating state is as simple as calling a state setter function.

Calling the state setter signals to React that the component needs to re-render, so the whole function defining the component is called again. The magic of useState() is that it allows React to keep track of the current value of state from one render to the next!

## Initialize State
Great work building out your first stateful function component in the last exercise. Just like you used the State Hook to manage a variable with string values, we can use the State Hook to manage the value of any primitive data type and even data collections like arrays and objects!

Have a look at the following function component. What data type does this state variable hold?
```JS
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
function ToggleLoading() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState();
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The data is {isLoading ? 'Loading' : 'Not Loading'}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setIsLoading(true)}>
        Turn Loading On
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setIsLoading(false)}>
        Turn Loading Off
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The ToggleLoading() function component above is using the simplest of all data types, a boolean. Booleans are frequently used in React applications to represent whether data has loaded or not. In the example above, we see that true and false values are passed to the state setter, setIsLoading(). This code works just fine as is, but what if we want our component to start off with isLoading set to true?

To initialize our state with any value we want, we simply pass the initial value as an argument to the useState() function call.
```JS
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
```

There are three ways in which this code affects our component:
1. During the first render, the initial state argument is used.
2. When the state setter is called, React ignores the initial state argument and uses the new value.
3. When the component re-renders for any other reason, React continues to use the same value from the previous render.

If we don’t pass an initial value when calling useState(), then the current value of the state during the first render will be undefined. Often, this is perfectly fine for the machines, but it can be unclear to the humans reading our code. So, we prefer to explicitly initialize our state. If we don’t have the value needed during the first render, we can explicitly pass null instead of just passively leaving the value as undefined.

## Separate Hooks for Separate States
While there are times when it can be helpful to store related data in a data collection like an array or object, it can also be helpful to separate data that changes separately into completely different state variables. Managing dynamic data is much easier when we keep our data models as simple as possible.

For example, if we had a single object that held state for a subject you are studying at school, it might look something like this:
```JS
function Subject() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    currentGrade: 'B',
    classmates: ['Hasan', 'Sam', 'Emma'],
    classDetails: {topic: 'Math', teacher: 'Ms. Barry', room: 201};
    exams: [{unit: 1, score: 91}, {unit: 2, score: 88}]);
});
```

This would work, but think about how messy it could get to copy over all the other values when we need to update something in this big state object. For example, to update the grade on an exam, we would need an event handler that did something like this:
```JS
setState((prev) => ({
 ...prev,
  exams: prev.exams.map((exam) => {
    if( exam.unit === updatedExam.unit ){
      return { 
        ...exam,
        score: updatedExam.score
      };
    } else {
      return exam;
    }
  }),
}));
```

Yikes! Complex code like this is likely to cause bugs! Luckily, there is another option… We can make more than one call to the State Hook. In fact, we can make as many calls to useState() as we want! It’s best to split state into multiple state variables based on which values tend to change together. We can rewrite the previous example as follows…
```JS
function Subject() {
  const [currentGrade, setGrade] = useState('B');
  const [classmates, setClassmates] = useState(['Hasan', 'Sam', 'Emma']);
  const [classDetails, setClassDetails] = useState({topic: 'Math', teacher: 'Ms. Barry', room: 201});
  const [exams, setExams] = useState([{unit: 1, score: 91}, {unit: 2, score: 88}]);
  // ...
}
```

Managing dynamic data with separate state variables has many advantages, like making our code more simple to write, read, test, and reuse across components.

Often, we find ourselves packaging up and organizing data in collections to pass between components, then separating that very same data within components where different parts of the data change separately. The wonderful thing about working with Hooks is that we have the freedom to organize our data the way that makes the most sense to us!

If you’d like, have a look at another example of using [multiple State Hooks for managing separate data](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#tip-using-multiple-state-variables).

## Lesson Review
Awesome work, we can now build “stateful” function components using the useState React Hook!

Let’s review what we learned and practiced in this lesson:
* With React, we feed static and dynamic data models to JSX to render a view to the screen
* Use Hooks to “hook into” internal component state for managing dynamic data in function components
* We employ the State Hook by using the code below:
  * currentState to reference the current value of state
  * stateSetter to reference a function used to update the value of this state
  * the initialState argument to initialize the value of state for the component’s first render
  ```JS
  const [currentState, stateSetter] = useState( initialState );
  ```
* Call state setters in event handlers
* Define simple event handlers inline with our JSX event listeners and define complex event handlers outside of our JSX
* Use a state setter callback function when our next value depends on our previous value
* Use arrays and objects to organize and manage related data that tends to change together
* Use the spread syntax on collections of dynamic data to copy the previous state into the next state like so: setArrayState((prev) => [ ...prev ]) and setObjectState((prev) => ({ ...prev }))
* Split state into multiple, simpler variables instead of throwing it all into one state object

# The Effect Hook

## Why Use useEffect?
Before Hooks, function components were only used to accept data in the form of props and return some JSX to be rendered. However, as we learned in the last lesson, the State Hook allows us to manage dynamic data, in the form of component state, within our function components.

In this lesson, we’ll use the Effect Hook to run some JavaScript code after each render, such as:
* fetching data from a backend service
* subscribing to a stream of data
* managing timers and intervals
* reading from and making changes to the DOM

## Why after each render?
Most interesting components will re-render multiple times throughout their lifetime and these key moments present the perfect opportunity to execute these “side effects”.

There are three key moments when the Effect Hook can be utilized:
1. When the component is first added, or mounted, to the DOM and renders
2. When the state or props change, causing the component to re-render
3. When the component is removed, or unmounted, from the DOM.

Later on in this lesson, we’ll learn how to further fine-tune exactly when this code executes.

## Function Component Effects
Let’s break down how our PageTitle() function component is using the Effect Hook to execute some code after each render!
```JS
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 
function PageTitle() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
 
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Hi, ${name}`;
  });
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Use the input field below to rename this page!</p>
      <input onChange={({target}) => setName(target.value)} value={name} type='text' />
    </div>
  );
}
```

First, we import the Effect Hook from the react library, like so:
```JS
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

The Effect Hook is used to call another function that does something for us so there is nothing returned when we call the useEffect() function.

The first argument passed to the useEffect() function is the callback function that we want React to call after each time this component renders. We will refer to this callback function as our effect.

In our example, the effect is:
```JS
() => { document.title = name; }
```

In our effect, we assign the value of the name variable to the document.title. For more on this syntax, have a look at this [explanation of the document’s title property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/title).

Notice how we use the current state inside of our effect. Even though our effect is called after the component renders, we still have access to the variables in the scope of our function component! When React renders our component, it will update the DOM as usual, and then run our effect after the DOM has been updated. This happens for every render, including the first and last one.

## Clean Up Effects
Some effects require cleanup. For example, we might want to add event listeners to some element in the DOM, beyond the JSX in our component. When we add event listeners to the DOM, it is important to remove those event listeners when we are done with them to avoid memory leaks!

Let’s consider the following effect:
```JS
useEffect(()=>{
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  };
})
```

If our effect didn’t return a cleanup function, then a new event listener would be added to the DOM’s document object every time that our component re-renders. Not only would this cause bugs, but it could cause our application performance to diminish and maybe even crash!

Because effects run after every render and not just once, React calls our cleanup function before each re-render and before unmounting to clean up each effect call.

If our effect returns a function, then the useEffect() Hook always treats that as a cleanup function. React will call this cleanup function before the component re-renders or unmounts. Since this cleanup function is optional, it is our responsibility to return a cleanup function from our effect when our effect code could create memory leaks.

## Control When Effects Are Called
The useEffect() function calls its first argument (the effect) after each time a component renders. We’ve learned how to return a cleanup function so that we don’t create performance issues and other bugs, but sometimes we want to skip calling our effect on re-renders altogether.

It is common, when defining function components, to run an effect only when the component mounts (renders the first time), but not when the component re-renders. The Effect Hook makes this very easy for us to do! If we want to only call our effect after the first render, we pass an empty array to useEffect() as the second argument. This second argument is called the dependency array.

The dependency array is used to tell the useEffect() method when to call our effect and when to skip it. Our effect is always called after the first render but only called again if something in our dependency array has changed values between renders.

We will continue to learn more about this second argument over the next few exercises, but for now, we’ll focus on using an empty dependency array to call an effect when a component first mounts, and if a cleanup function is returned by our effect, calling that when the component unmounts.
```JS
useEffect(() => {
  alert("component rendered for the first time");
  return () => {
    alert("component is being removed from the DOM");
  };
}, []); 
```

Without passing an empty array as the second argument to the useEffect() above, those alerts would be displayed before and after every render of our component, which is clearly not when those messages are meant to be displayed. Simply, passing [] to the useEffect() function is enough to configure when the effect and cleanup functions are called!

## Fetch Data
When building software, we often start with default behaviors then modify them to improve performance. We’ve learned that the default behavior of the Effect Hook is to call the effect function after every single render. Next, we learned that we can pass an empty array as the second argument for useEffect() if we only want our effect to be called after the component’s first render. In this exercise, we’ll learn to use the dependency array to further configure exactly when we want our effect to be called!

When our effect is responsible for fetching data from a server, we pay extra close attention to when our effect is called. Unnecessary round trips back and forth between our React components and the server can be costly in terms of:
* Processing
* Performance
* Data usage for mobile users
* API service fees

When the data that our components need to render doesn’t change, we can pass an empty dependency array, so that the data is fetched after the first render. When the response is received from the server, we can use a state setter from the State Hook to store the data from the server’s response in our local component state for future renders. Using the State Hook and the Effect Hook together in this way is a powerful pattern that saves our components from unnecessarily fetching new data after every render!

An empty dependency array signals to the Effect Hook that our effect never needs to be re-run, that it doesn’t depend on anything. Specifying zero dependencies means that the result of running that effect won’t change and calling our effect once is enough.

A dependency array that is not empty signals to the Effect Hook that it can skip calling our effect after re-renders unless the value of one of the variables in our dependency array has changed. If the value of a dependency has changed, then the Effect Hook will call our effect again!

Here’s a nice example from the [official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects):
```JS
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if the value stored by count changes
```

## Rules of Hooks
There are two main rules to keep in mind when using Hooks:
* only call Hooks at the top level
* only call Hooks from React functions

As we have been practicing with the State Hook and the Effect Hook, we’ve been following these rules with ease, but it is helpful to keep these two rules in mind as you take your new understanding of Hooks out into the wild and begin using [more Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) in your React applications.

When React builds the Virtual DOM, the library calls the functions that define our components over and over again as the user interacts with the user interface. React keeps track of the data and functions that we are managing with Hooks based on their order in the function component’s definition. For this reason, we always call our Hooks at the top level; we never call hooks inside of loops, conditions, or nested functions.

Instead of confusing React with code like this:
```JS
if (userName !== '') {
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('savedUserName', userName);
  });
}
```

We can accomplish the same goal, while consistently calling our Hook every time:
```JS
useEffect(() => {
  if (userName !== '') {
    localStorage.setItem('savedUserName', userName);
  }
});
```

Secondly, Hooks can only be used in React Functions. We cannot use Hooks in class components and we cannot use Hooks in regular JavaScript functions. We’ve been working with useState() and useEffect() in function components, and this is the most common use. The only other place where Hooks can be used is within custom hooks. Custom Hooks are incredibly useful for organizing and reusing stateful logic between function components. For more on this topic, head to the [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html).

## Separate Hooks for Separate Effects
When multiple values are closely related and change at the same time, it can make sense to group these values in a collection like an object or array. Packaging data together can also add complexity to the code responsible for managing that data. Therefore, it is a good idea to separate concerns by managing different data with different Hooks.

Compare the complexity here, where data is bundled up into a single object:
```JS
// Handle both position and menuItems with one useEffect hook.
const [data, setData] = useState({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 } });
useEffect(() => {
  get('/menu').then((response) => {
    setData((prev) => ({ ...prev, menuItems: response.data }));
  });
  const handleMove = (event) =>
    setData((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      position: { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }
    }));
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMove);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMove);
}, []);
```

To the simplicity here, where we have separated concerns:
```JS
// Handle menuItems with one useEffect hook.
const [menuItems, setMenuItems] = useState(null);
useEffect(() => {
  get('/menu').then((response) => setMenuItems(response.data));
}, []);
 
// Handle position with a separate useEffect hook.
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMove = (event) =>
    setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMove);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMove);
}, []);
```

It is not always obvious [whether to bundle data together or separate it](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#should-i-use-one-or-many-state-variables), but with practice, we get better at organizing our code so that it is easier to understand, add to, reuse, and test!

## Lesson Review
In this lesson, we learned how to write effects that manage timers, manipulate the DOM, and fetch data from a server. In earlier versions of React, we could only have executed this type of code in the [lifecycle methods of class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class), but with the Effect Hook, we can perform these types of actions in function components with ease!

Let’s review the main concepts from this lesson:
* useEffect() - we can import this function from the 'react' library and call it in our function components
* effect - refers to a function that we pass as the first argument of the useEffect() function. By default, the Effect Hook calls this effect after each render
* cleanup function - the function that is optionally returned by the effect. If the effect does anything that needs to be cleaned up to prevent memory leaks, then the effect returns a cleanup function, then the Effect Hook will call this cleanup function before calling the effect again as well as when the component is being unmounted
* dependency array - this is the optional second argument that the useEffect() function can be called with in order to prevent repeatedly calling the effect when this is not needed. This array should consist of all variables that the effect depends on.

The Effect Hook is all about scheduling when our effect’s code gets executed. We can use the dependency array to configure when our effect is called in the following ways:

| Dependency Array | Effect called after first render & … |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| undefined | every re-render |
| Empty array | no re-renders |
| Non-empty array | when any value in the dependency array changes |

Hooks gives us the flexibility to organize our code in different ways, grouping related data as well as separating concerns to keep code simple, error-free, reusable, and testable!
