# How to Hack Hacker News

![](./img/hackernews.webp)

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:
* title: the title of the story
* user: the user who submitted the story
* score: the score of the story
* timestamp: the time of the story
* url: the link of the story

Let’s get started!

1. Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table! Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories: What are the top five  stories with the highest scores?
```SQL
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

2. Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users ([1-9-90 Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture))). Is this true of Hacker News? Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points? First, find the total score of all the stories.
```SQL
SELECT SUM(score) FROM hacker_news;
```

3. Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories. Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores. GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!
```SQL
SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

4. Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage. Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:
```SQL
SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;
```

5. Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding. The url of the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ How many times has each offending user posted this link?
```SQL
SELECT user,
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## Which sites feed Hacker News?
6. Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites. Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most: GitHub, Medium, or New York Times? First, we want to categorize each story based on their source. We can do this using a CASE statement:
```SQL
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```
