# How to Hack Hacker News

![](./img/hackernews.webp)

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:
* title: the title of the story
* user: the user who submitted the story
* score: the score of the story
* timestamp: the time of the story
* url: the link of the story

This data was kindly made publicly available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT/).

Let’s get started!

1. Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table! Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories: What are the top five  stories with the highest scores?
```SQL
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
| title | score |
| ----- | ----- |
| Penny Arcade – Surface Pro 3 update | 517 |
| Hacking The Status Game | 309 |
| Postgres CLI with autocompletion and syntax highlighting | 304 |
| Stephen Fry hits out at ‘infantile’ culture of trigger words and safe spaces | 282 |
| Reversal: Australian Govt picks ODF doc standard over Microsoft | 191 |

2. Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users ([1-9-90 Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture))). Is this true of Hacker News? Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points? First, find the total score of all the stories.
```SQL
SELECT SUM(score) FROM hacker_news;
```
| SUM(score) |
| ---------- |
| 6366 |

3. Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories. Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores. GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!
```SQL
SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
| user | SUM(score) |
| ---- | ---------- |
| vxNsr | 517 |
| amirkhella | 309 |
| dmmalam | 304 |
| metafunctor | 282 |

4. Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage. Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:
```SQL
SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;
```
| (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0 |
| -------------------------------- |
| 0.221803330191643 |

5. Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding. The url of the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ How many times has each offending user posted this link?
```SQL
SELECT user,
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%'
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```
| user | COUNT(*) |
| ---- | -------- |
| sonnynomnom | 2 |
| scorpiosister | 1 |

## Which sites feed Hacker News?
6. Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites. Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most: GitHub, Medium, or New York Times? First, we want to categorize each story based on their source. We can do this using a CASE statement:
```SQL
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source'
FROM hacker_news;
```

7. Next, build on the previous query: Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using COUNT(). Also, GROUP BY the CASE statement. Remember that you can refer to a column in GROUP BY using a number.
```SQL
SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;
```
| Source | COUNT(*) |
| ------ | -------- |
| GitHub | 23 |
| Medium | 12 |
| New York Times| 13 |
| Other | 3952 |

8. Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but… What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News? Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column:
   ```SQL
   SELECT timestamp
   FROM hacker_news
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   Notice that the values are formatted like: `2018-05-08T12:30:00Z` If you ignore the T and Z, the format is: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
```sql
SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;
```
| timestamp |
| --------- |
| 2014-01-27T17:31:13Z |
| 2011-10-23T18:46:40Z |
| 2016-02-28T06:26:56Z |
| 2014-08-12T22:13:10Z |
| 2013-03-06T12:28:02Z |
| 2011-04-16T21:04:23Z |
| 2014-03-18T21:44:46Z |
| 2012-11-19T11:54:38Z |
| 2016-11-04T13:55:30Z |
| 2016-07-02T22:54:47Z |

9. SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date. It takes two arguments: `strftime(format, column)` Let’s test this function out:
   ```SQL
   SELECT timestamp,
      strftime('%H', timestamp)
   FROM hacker_news
   GROUP BY 1
   LIMIT 20;
   ```
   This returns the hour, HH, of the timestamp column!
   For strftime(__, timestamp):
   * %Y returns the year (YYYY)
   * %m returns the month (01-12)
   * %d returns the day of the month (1-31)
   * %H returns 24-hour clock (00-23)
   * %M returns the minute (00-59)
   * %S returns the seconds (00-59)

   if timestamp format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Read more on the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html).

| timestamp | strftime('%H', timestamp) |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| 2007-03-16T20:52:19Z | 20 |
| 2007-04-03T03:04:09Z | 03 |
| 2007-05-01T03:11:17Z | 03 |
| 2007-05-05T05:43:58Z | 05 |
| 2007-05-11T05:48:53Z | 05 |
| 2007-05-25T22:07:18Z | 22 |
| 2007-06-08T08:44:50Z | 08 |
| 2007-07-01T00:06:57Z | 00 |
| 2007-07-27T16:47:00Z | 16 |
| 2007-08-08T00:45:36Z | 00 |
| 2007-08-12T07:35:25Z | 07 |
| 2007-08-16T01:02:49Z | 01 |
| 2007-08-24T18:17:32Z | 18 |
| 2007-08-27T17:32:10Z | 17 |
| 2007-09-11T16:27:49Z | 16 |
| 2007-09-20T20:31:21Z | 20 |
| 2007-09-22T08:21:17Z | 08 |
| 2007-09-26T05:03:17Z | 05 |
| 2007-10-08T21:28:06Z | 21 |

10. Okay, now we understand how strftime() works. Let’s write a query that returns three columns:
   * The hours of the timestamp
   * The average score for each hour
   * The count of stories for each hour

```SQL
SELECT
   strftime('%H', timestamp), 
   AVG(score),
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```
| strftime('%H', timestamp) | AVG(score) | COUNT(*) |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
|  |  | 6 |
| 00 | 5.09090909090909 | 137 |
| 01 | 4.40740740740741 | 146 |
| 02 | 2.45 | 136 |
| 03 | 6.91304347826087 | 134 |
| 04 | 3.875 | 116 |
| 05 | 3.55172413793103 | 125 |
| 06 | 7.5 | 110 |
| 07 | 21.3333333333333 | 104 |
| 08 | 2.04166666666667 | 90 |
| 09 | 11.125 | 119 |
| 10 | 3.07894736842105 | 112 |
| 11 | 8.32258064516129 | 113 |
| 12 | 14.3103448275862 | 123 |
| 13 | 5.67647058823529 | 164 |
| 14 | 3.51515151515152 | 213 |
| 15 | 9.49122807017544 | 268 |
| 16 | 9.75555555555556 | 237 |
| 17 | 8.86046511627907 | 215 |
| 18 | 27.0277777777778 | 266 |
| 19 | 20.4137931034483 | 238 |
| 20 | 18.2758620689655 | 239 |
| 21 | 3.25 | 234 |
| 22 | 3.20833333333333 | 185 |
| 23 | 8.43478260869565 | 170 |

11. Let’s edit a few things in the previous query:
   * Round the average scores (ROUND()).
   * Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS).
   * Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp.
   
   Take a look at the result again: What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?

```SQL
SELECT
  strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hour',
  ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS 'Average Score',
  COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

| Hour | Average Score | Number of Stories |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| 00 | 5.1 | 137 |
| 01 | 4.4 | 146 |
| 02 | 2.5 | 136 |
| 03 | 6.9 | 134 |
| 04 | 3.9 | 116 |
| 05 | 3.6 | 125 |
| 06 | 7.5 | 110 |
| 07 | 21.3 | 104 |
| 08 | 2.0 | 90 |
| 09 | 11.1 | 119 |
| 10 | 3.1 | 112 |
| 11 | 8.3 | 113 |
| 12 | 14.3 | 123 |
| 13 | 5.7 | 164 |
| 14 | 3.5 | 213 |
| 15 | 9.5 | 268 |
| 16 | 9.8 | 237 |
| 17 | 8.9 | 215 |
| 18 | 27.0 | 266 |
| 19 | 20.4 | 238 |
| 20 | 18.3 | 239 |
| 21 | 3.3 | 234 |
| 22 | 3.2 | 185 |
| 23 | 8.4 | 170 |
