1. Let’s examine the three tables.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

| id | date | pickup | dropoff | rider_id | car_id | type | cost |
| -- | ---- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| 1001 | 2017-12-05 | 06:45 | 07:10 | 102 | 1 | X | 28.66 |
| 1002 | 2017-12-05 | 08:00 | 08:15 | 101 | 3 | POOL | 9.11 |
| 1003 | 2017-12-05 | 09:30 | 09:50 | 104 | 4 | X | 24.98 |
| 1004 | 2017-12-05 | 13:40 | 14:05 | 105 | 1 | X | 31.27 |
| 1005 | 2017-12-05 | 15:15 | 16:00 | 103 | 2 | POOL | 18.95 |
| 1006 | 2017-12-05 | 18:20 | 18:55 | 101 | 3 | XL | 78.52 |

| id | first | last | username | rating | total_trips | referred |
| -- | ----- | ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 101 | Sonny | Li | @sonnynomnom | 4.66 | 352 | |
| 102 | Laura | Breiman | @lauracle | 4.99 | 687 | 101 |
| 103 | Kassa | Korley | @kassablanca | 4.63 | 42 |	|
| 104 | Yakov | Kagan | @yakovkagan | 4.52 | 1910 | 103 |

| id | model | OS | status | trips_completed |
| -- | ----- | -- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1 | Ada | Ryzac | active | 82 |
| 2 | Ada | Ryzac | active | 30 |
| 3 | Turing XL | Ryzac | active | 164 |
| 4 | Akira | Finux | maintenance | 22 |


3. Try out a simple cross join between riders and cars. Is the result useful?
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
CROSS JOIN cars;
-- Using Selection alone
SELECT
  riders.first,
  riders.last,
  cars.model
FROM riders, cars;
```

4. Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users. Find the columns to join between trips and riders and combine the two tables using a LEFT JOIN. Let trips be the left table.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

SELECT trips.date, 
   trips.pickup, 
   trips.dropoff, 
   trips.type, 
   trips.cost,
   riders.first, 
   riders.last,
   riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

5. Suppose we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips. Find the columns to join on and combine the trips and cars table using an INNER JOIN.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips
INNER JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;
```

6. The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month. Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2;
```

7. What is the average cost for a trip?
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2) AS 'average trip cost' FROM trips;
```

8. Lyft is looking to do an email campaign for all the irregular users. Find all the riders who have used Lyft less than 500 times!
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```

9. Calculate the number of cars that are active.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';
```

10. It’s safety recall time for cars that have been on the road for a while. Write a query that finds the two cars that have the highest trips_completed.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC LIMIT 2;
```
