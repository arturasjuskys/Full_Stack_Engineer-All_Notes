1. Let’s examine the three tables.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips;
SELECT * FROM riders;
SELECT * FROM cars;
```

3. Try out a simple cross join between riders and cars. Is the result useful?
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
CROSS JOIN cars;
-- Using Selection alone
SELECT
  riders.first,
  riders.last,
  cars.model
FROM riders, cars;
```

4. Suppose we want to create a Trip Log with the trips and its users. Find the columns to join between trips and riders and combine the two tables using a LEFT JOIN. Let trips be the left table.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

SELECT trips.date, 
   trips.pickup, 
   trips.dropoff, 
   trips.type, 
   trips.cost,
   riders.first, 
   riders.last,
   riders.username
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;
```

5. Suppose we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips. Find the columns to join on and combine the trips and cars table using an INNER JOIN.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM trips
INNER JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;
```

6. The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month. Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2;
```

## Bunus: Queries and Aggregates

7. What is the average cost for a trip?
```SQL
SELECT ROUND(AVG(cost), 2) AS 'average trip cost' FROM trips;
```

8. Lyft is looking to do an email campaign for all the irregular users. Find all the riders who have used Lyft less than 500 times!
```SQL
SELECT * FROM riders
WHERE total_trips < 500
UNION
SELECT * FROM riders2
WHERE total_trips < 500;
```

9. Calculate the number of cars that are active.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE status = 'active';
```

10. It’s safety recall time for cars that have been on the road for a while. Write a query that finds the two cars that have the highest trips_completed.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM cars
ORDER BY trips_completed DESC LIMIT 2;
```
