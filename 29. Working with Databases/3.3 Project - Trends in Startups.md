2. Calculate the total number of companies in the table.
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM startups;
```
3. We want to know the total value of all companies in this table. Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.
```SQL
SELECT SUM(valuation) FROM startups;
```

4. What is the highest amount raised by a startup? Return the maximum amount of money raised.
```SQL
SELECT name, MAX(raised) FROM startups;
```

5. Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.
```SQL
SELECT name, MAX(raised) FROM startups WHERE stage = 'Seed';
```

6. In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?
```SQL
SELECT name, MIN(founded) FROM startups;
```

7. Return the average valuation.
```SQL
SELECT AVG(valuation) FROM startups;
```

8. Return the average valuation, in each category.
```SQL
SELECT category, AVG(valuation) FROM startups GROUP BY category;
```

9. Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places.
```SQL
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

10. Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places. Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.
```SQL
SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) FROM startups
GROUP BY category ORDER BY valuation DESC;
```

11. First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.
```SQL
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM startups
GROUP BY category;
```

12. Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?
```SQL
SELECT category, COUNT(name) FROM startups
GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(name) > 3 ORDER BY name DESC;
```

13. What is the average size of a startup in each location?
```SQL
SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees)) FROM startups
GROUP BY location ORDER BY employees DESC;
```

14. What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?
```SQL
SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees)) FROM startups
GROUP BY location HAVING AVG(employees) > 500;
```
